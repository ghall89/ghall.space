After [freeing my music library](/blog/2026/setting-my-music-free), I knew the one thing I would miss from Apple Music was the discovery aspect. It was very easy to just open the music app and browse suggestions for new music to check out, or releases from artists I enjoy that maybe I haven’t heard yet.

I’ve been using [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/) on my Mac and iPhone to manage and listen to my library, and while poking around the settings I discovered [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) integration. What a throwback!

I signed up for an account – my old account is either connected to an email I no longer have access to, or long since deleted – and started “scrobbling".

Over the last week-and-a-half, I’ve listened to 668 different songs from 120 artists across 186 albums, and it’s been fun seeing some of the suggestions that have come from that. It’s been a good mix of stuff I have in my library but haven’t listened to in a while, and new music I probably never would have found otherwise.
