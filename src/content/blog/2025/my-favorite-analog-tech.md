I‚Äôm a bit of a tech nerd, so it‚Äôs no surprise that I love my gadgets. While it is fun to talk about my computer setup, or how I use my smartphone, it‚Äôs not something I particularly enjoy writing about, unless I feel like I have something interesting to share, or I‚Äôm doing my yearly ‚ÄúDefault Apps‚Äù update.

But, inspired in part by my [intentional analog time](blog/2025/intentional-analog-time/), I thought it might be fun to take a look at my analog tech setup ‚Äì that is, gadgets I love and use almost every day that aren‚Äôt a computer or computer-adjacent.

## Electric Kettle

When I moved into my current place, I found myself stuck with a gas stove. I‚Äôm not a fan of them for many reasons, one of which is how much longer it takes to boil a kettle of water. I drink a lot of tea, and enjoy pour-over coffee, so I decided to replace my stovetop kettle with an electric one, and I don‚Äôt think I can ever go back. They‚Äôre so fast, and you don‚Äôt have to have your eardrums blasted by the whistle of a stovetop kettle.

I probably could have gone with a nicer one, but [this one](https://shopelitegourmet.com/collections/electric-kettles/products/1l-glass-kettle?variant=37480151482526) from Elite Gourmet has done the job for a couple years now.

## Record Player

Listening to music is a big part of my life. While I do love having almost any album I want at my fingertips, there‚Äôs something more personal about putting on a record. Perhaps it's the tactility of placing the vinyl disc on the platter and lowering the needle, or maybe it‚Äôs the ‚Äúwarmness‚Äù of the analog sound, but it provides a very different experience than digital streaming.

My turntable of choice is the [RT80](https://www.fluance.com/rt80-high-fidelity-vinyl-turntable-record-player-with-premium-cartridge-diamond-needle) from Fluance.

## Smoothie Blender

I‚Äôve historically eaten less fruit due to some digestive issues, which I won‚Äôt go into here. But I always enjoy a good smoothie.

So, I decided to get a smoothie blender to improve my fruit intake, and have some fun concocting smoothie recipes. My favorite recipe so far is a peanut butter and banana smoothie, made with unsweetened vanilla oat milk, and a hint of cacao.

I had some trouble tracking it down, but I use [this one](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=frigidaire+smoothie+blender+retro&i=garden&page=2&xpid=pPphYp9Iq1rgo&crid=3HQNHUXD2UICY&qid=1760648409&sprefix=frigidaire+smoothie+blender+retro%2Cgarden%2C69&ref=sr_pg_1) from Frigidaire.

## Handheld Vacuum

I hate vacuuming. I don‚Äôt know what it is about it, but it‚Äôs one of my least favorite chores. However, I find sweeping kind of relaxing[^1]. In addition, I find most household vacuums unwieldy, and you have to deal with plugging and unplugging cords because god forbid they make a cord long enough to cover a 1-bedroom apartment‚Ä¶sorry where was I?

Anyway, I‚Äôve found cleaning to be much more agreeable when I‚Äôm sweeping the floor, and then, when I‚Äôm done, vacuuming up the dirt piles, and reaching the various un-sweepable crevices with a much more manageable handheld, battery-powered vacuum.

Again, I had trouble finding my exact model, but [this guy](https://www.blackanddecker.com/products/chv1410l?variant=43205384831197) from Black & Decker is a slightly fancier (and uglier) version of the model I have

[^1]: I suppose this is some psychological conditioning from my food service days, when sweeping the floor meant my shift was almost over. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
