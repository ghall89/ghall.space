# Now

What's a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

_Last updated: January 17, 2026_

Currently unemployed, looking for a new job in web development. In between applying for jobs, I've been volunteering as a maintainer on a website for a humanitarian aid organization, and working on side projects on both web and Mac.

## 🎧 Listening

## 🎮 Playing

**[Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.igdb.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii) - PS5**

Playing a co-op campaign with some friends. We've been playing for a few hours almost weekly. We recently made it to Act 3.

**[Ghost of Yōtei](https://www.igdb.com/games/ghost-of-yotei) - PS5**

I picked this up with a gift card I got for the holidays, and I've been very much enjoying it. I've been finding it challenging, but not in a frustrating way.

**[Pokémon Legends: Z-A](https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a) - Switch**

Another game I picked up with a gift card. Initially I didn't have much interest in this, but I decided to give it a chance since I am a life-long Pokémon fan.

## 🎲 Rolling

**[Knarr](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/379629/knarr)**

One of my favorite games in my collection, and it gets played more than any other. Read more [here](/blog/2025/knarr-a-pretty-cool-game).

**[CuBirds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245476/cubirds)**

I bring this with me to board gaming sessions alongside Knarr, but it doesn't get played quite as much. Would love to get more plays in.

**[Point Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/431998/point-galaxy)**

I've got one play of this in recently, and I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I want to get more plays in to get a better idea if I like it. I did enjoy Point Salad, which this game is a reimplementation of.

## 📺 Watching

**[Poker Face](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/120998-poker-face)**

Finally checking this show out after hearing it mentioned a million times on the [Triple Click podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/). I have enjoyed everything I've seen from Rian Johnson so I figured I should finally just check it out.

**[Taskmaster](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/63404-taskmaster)**

Been needing a bit of silly entertainment in my life, so I've been going back and rewatching my favorite series'.
