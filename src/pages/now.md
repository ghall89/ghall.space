# Now

What's a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

_Last updated: February 21, 2026_

Currently unemployed, looking for a new job in web development. In between applying for jobs, I've been volunteering as a maintainer on the website for a humanitarian aid organization, and working on side projects on both web and Mac.

I'm currently building a music player for iPhone, because I [recently liberated my music collection from streaming](/blog/2026/setting-my-music-free), and I've not been happy with any of the existing options.

## 🎧 Listening

- [Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party - Hayley Williams](https://album.link/i/1833006180)
- [Hades II Soundtrack - Darren Korb](https://album.link/us/i/1852248640)
- [Late Show - The Beaches](https://album.link/i/1440897088)

## 🎮 Playing

**[Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.igdb.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii) - PS5**

Playing a co-op campaign with some friends. We've been playing for a few hours almost weekly. We are currently deep in Act 3.

**[Star Ocean: The Second Story R](https://www.igdb.com/games/star-ocean-the-second-story-r) - Switch**

Picked this up again after taking an extended break, still trying to find my bearings and deciding if I should just start a new save...

## 🎲 Rolling

**[Grand Austria Hotel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182874/grand-austria-hotel)**

My favorite heavy game of the moment. I don't own a copy but I've been playing it anytime I get a chance.

**[Knarr](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/379629/knarr)**

One of my favorite games in my collection, and it gets played more than any other. Read more [here](/blog/2025/knarr-a-pretty-cool-game).

**[CuBirds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245476/cubirds)**

I bring this with me to board gaming sessions alongside Knarr, but it doesn't get played quite as much. Would love to get more plays in.

## 📺 Watching

Nothing at the moment...
