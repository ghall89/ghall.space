## 🎮 Playing

**[Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.igdb.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii) - PS5**

Playing a co-op campaign with some friends. We've been playing for a few hours almost weekly.

**[Rise of the Tomb Raider](https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider) - PS5**

Recently finished [Tomb Raider](https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider--2) on the Nintendo Switch. Left me wanting more, so decided to replay this. 

## 🎲 Rolling

**[Knarr](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/379629/knarr)**

One of my favorite games in my collection, and it gets played more than any other. Read more [here](/blog/2025/knarr-a-pretty-cool-game).

**[Fall of Rome](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/260428/fall-of-rome)**

Mainly been playing this solo. Keep hoping someone else will want to play. 🥲

Maybe someday...

**[CuBirds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245476/cubirds)**

I bring this with me to board gaming sessions alongside Knarr, but it doesn't get played quite as much. Would love to get more plays in.
