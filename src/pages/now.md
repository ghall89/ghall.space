# Now

What's a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

_Last updated: December 7, 2025_

Currently unemployed, looking for a new job in web development. In between applying for jobs, I've been volunteering as a maintainer on a website for a humanitarian aid organization, and working on side projects on both web and Mac. 

## 🎧 Listening

- [Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party - Hayley Williams](https://album.link/i/1833006180)
- [The Else - They Might Be Giants](https://album.link/i/635922095)

## 🎮 Playing

**[Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.igdb.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii) - PS5**

Playing a co-op campaign with some friends. We've been playing for a few hours almost weekly. We recently made it to Act 3.

**[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberpunk-2077) - PS5**

Picked up the [Phantom Liberty](https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty) expansion back when it launched in 2023, and only just started playing it. I also plan on finishing the main game at long last. 

## 🎲 Rolling

**[Knarr](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/379629/knarr)**

One of my favorite games in my collection, and it gets played more than any other. Read more [here](/blog/2025/knarr-a-pretty-cool-game).

**[Fall of Rome](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/260428/fall-of-rome)**

Mainly been playing this solo. Keep hoping someone else will want to play. 🥲

Maybe someday...

**[CuBirds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245476/cubirds)**

I bring this with me to board gaming sessions alongside Knarr, but it doesn't get played quite as much. Would love to get more plays in. 

## 📺 Watching

- Nothing at the moment... ☹️
