For the last year-and-a-half this has simply been home to my portfolio, but for a while now I’ve wanted to expand from a simple, single-page site to a multi-page site with a blog (which you are of course reading right now).\n\nIn the previous version of this site, I coded myself into a corner. I did a lot of little things I thought were cool, but maybe weren’t the best ideas design-wise, and put things together in such a way that I couldn’t simply tweak things very easily. One of the lessons I took from the experience of building and maintaining that site was to keep things simple, and not try to be too flashy for the sake of being flashy.\n\nAnother lesson I took was to plan ahead for any changes. I didn’t really think about wanting to start a blog until after the site was up, and if I had made things a little easier by planning for future changes it probably wouldn’t have taken a “nuke-and-pave” to cleanly integrate a blog.\n\nI’m also a much better developer than I was when I built version 2. Not saying I’m amazing, I’ve only been at this since late 2020 after all, but I’ve learned a lot about coding, and organizing code in a way that makes sense. Of course, a year from now I’ll be wondering what the heck I was thinking when I originally wrote the code for this site.\n\nAnyway, the first step to any project like this is deciding on the tech stack. As this is a solo project, being my personal site and all, I had a bit of leeway to experiment with different pieces of that puzzle, but I decided on the following:\n\n### Front-end Framework: Next.js\n\nI’m a relative newcomer to Next.js, as I’ve only been using it for about 2 months now. But the learning curve was really low coming from React, and I was able to pick it up pretty quickly when I started my current job.\n\nI prefer it to straight React in a few ways, one of the biggest being how easy it is to set up a multi-page site like this. While it’s definitely possible in React, Next.js makes it painfully simple. It was a no-brainer, and it got me rolling so fast I was able to built this website in a matter of days.\n\n[Check out Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n\nFor styling, I went with good old Tailwind, which I also used on the previous iteration of my site. I’m a very visual person, and Tailwind makes it so easy for me to just built the designs I have in my head.\n\n[Check out Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n\n### Headless CMS: Cosmic\n\nOn the previous iteration of my website, I had built a rudimentary CMS in the command line using M3O for a database, which I then served to the front-end through a small API I built. It was slow and clunky, but it was good enough for periodically updating my portfolio. But, when M3O changed their pricing model, this system became economically infeasible, so I switched to essentially hardcoding my portoflio into my sourcecode, which was something I wanted to avoid. Also, it made the fact I was building my front-end in React a little silly since I had eliminated the one bit of dynamic content on my website. But it was serving its purpose, so I left it.\n\nFor this new iteration, since I wanted to not only go back to managing my portfolio on the back-end, but also build a blog, I knew the best thing to do was to find a pre-packaged solution so I could spend more time focusing on my strengths.\n\n[Check out Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/)\n\n### Final Notes\n\nThere are a couple little Node packages I’ve used to make things a little easier, such as [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), [react-jsx-parser](https://github.com/TroyAlford/react-jsx-parser), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). I particularly had fun with Framer Motion, but I ended up really toning down some of the animations.\n\nAlso, I ended up using the ever-popular VS Code as my text editor instead of my usual go-to, [Nova](https://nova.app/). I started using VS Code again for the first time since early 2021 because of work, and I quickly got spoiled by a lot of the autocomplete features, expecially automatic imports. There will definitly be a breakdown of my thoughts about VS Code vs Nova at some point in the future.\n\n---\n\n_This post was originally published on my (now defunct) blog on my portfolio site [ghall.dev](https://ghall.dev), and was republished here for archival purposes._","src/content/blog/2022/building-ghalldev-30.md","e613db37e72d2ffe",{"html":21,"metadata":22},"\u003Cp>Welcome to my brand new website, the 3rd iteration of ghall.dev!

Whether it’s a problem I’m stuck on, or something about the codebase I don’t quite understand, I’m more likely to end up banging my head against the wall trying to find the answers myself than reach out and ask someone a question.\n\nIt’s not out of pride, at least I don’t think it is. It’s more about insecurity. I’m afraid asking for help will somehow reveal to the more experienced devs that I actually have no idea what I’m doing. I will expose myself as a fraud who doesn’t know the first thing about development, and I don’t deserve to get paid for it.\n\nOf course, logically speaking, this is not true. It’s a story told with a combination of imposter syndrome, an anxiety disorder, and a copious amount of logical fallacies. I’m not a fraud, I’m just inexperienced. I can write code, and it may not be the best code ever written but it generally works, and there’s room for me to improve.\n\nAll this to say, it’s ok to ask for help when you need it. I’m writing that as a reminder to myself as much as to you, the reader. No one person has all the answers, and in development there are a multitude of ways to solve a given problem. Consider this: you’re more competent than you give yourself credit for, but maybe you just need a fresh perspective.\n\nI had couple eye-opening experiences this week at work.\n\nFirstly, I was running into an issue where a particular set of values wasn’t getting passed through correctly in our beta environment even though everything was working perfectly when I tested locally on my machine. I was stumped. My boss took a look and suggested I get the values I needed from somewhere else. It worked like a charm! In retrospect, it seemed like the obvious solution, but its easy to get so caught up in looking at a problem in a particular way that you lose sight of other perspectives. In this case, it wasn’t that I didn’t understand what I was doing, I just needed another perspective.\n\nSecondly, earlier in the week I was struggling with trying to track down a particular issue in AWS. I couldn’t find the log I was looking for, and I was completely perplexed. I asked a co-worker, and he asked me if anyone showed me our naming convention for our serverless functions and how to navigate them in AWS. I said no, so he took about 10-15 minutes to show me the ropes. It was something I couldn’t have known, I’d had zero AWS experience before this job and I’m still in the process of getting to grips with our massive codebase. Nobody had taught me what I needed to know, and I had been too nervous to ask, so I just flat out didn’t know.\n\nSo, if there’s one thing I hope we all can take away from this it’s that, if we’re truly stuck on something, there’s more harm in not asking questions. There will always be something you don’t know, and there will always be another way of looking at a problem you’re facing. As long as you’re not asking for help as a first resort, and you’re putting in the effort to try and solve the problem yourself, then just ask the darn question!\n\nAnd if you’re ever feeling any doubt, come back and read this post. I know I will.\n\n---\n\n_This post was originally published on my (now defunct) blog on my portfolio site [ghall.dev](https://ghall.dev), and was republished here for archival purposes._","src/content/blog/2022/ask-the-darn-question.md","4cb275af5430623a",{"html":47,"metadata":48},"\u003Cp>One of the areas I struggle with when it comes to working in a professional web development environment is asking questions.

As you can imagine, it's not an easy topic by any means, as it's something that profoundly affects me personally on a daily basis.\n\nFor a decent chunk of this past week, I've been struggling with a bit of a depressive episode. For me this manifests as lack of motivation, and especially \"brain fog\", which just kills my logical thinking and problem solving skills. Obviously this is not ideal for web development, but I've found ways to make it work and maintain some level of productivity, even if it's not my absolute best.\n\n### Getting Motivated\n\nThe first step to overcoming anything is showing up.\n\nWhether I'm laying in bed wishing I could just go back to sleep, or sitting at my computer struggling to make myself just open my code editor, I have to find a way to get myself motivated. When I'm hitting these low points, I've found it incredibly helpful to break things down into tiny pieces and just work through them a piece at a time.\n\nIf I'm struggling to get out of bed, instead of trying to motivate myself to get up because I need to go to work, I focus on the process one step at a time. It's far easier to motivate myself to do a bunch of little things in sequence than it is to motivate myself to reach the end goal.\n\nThis even applies to just tackling things throughout the day. Today I had a rather large task to complete, and I was simply not motivated to do it. I took it one step at a time, down to the most mundane steps like executing a CLI command, or opening a file. I didn't have to be motivated to finish the task as a whole, I just had to motivate myself to tackle each step until I finished.\n\n### Navigating the Fog\n\nBrain fog is a complicated one. I first experienced the impact it has on coding when I was working on homework for boot camp. It's resulted in me blankly staring at a block of code and just totally forgetting how to read it, or just forgetting the name of a variable I defined less than a minute earlier.\n\nIt's so unbelievably frustrating to experience. The knowledge required to understand the code, the ability needed to problem solve the issue, it's all in there somewhere but it feels like that particular brain function is out of scope.\n\nOne of my bad habits to tackle this problem is coffee. I hate to admit it, but it does help take the edge of the fog.\n\nFirstly, I'd suggest some preventative measures like sleeping, getting some sun when you can, and using a light therapy lamp in the morning on those dark rainy mornings. It seems obvious, but it's worth mentioning these things help manage depression, and, by extension, brain fog.\n\nBut if you're in the moment, the best thing you can do is just step away from the computer for a few minutes. Get up, stretch, walk around, do some jumping jacks, go outside, whatever you can do to just get away from the problem and get your body moving. It's good advice for anyone facing a programming problem, but it's especially good if you're struggling with a bit of brain fog.\n\n### Be Kind to Yourself\n\nThrough all this, the most important thing to remember is to be kind to yourself.\n\nI tend to be extremely self-critical on the best of days, but when I'm struggling and not producing my best work I am even more so. I have to remind myself that this isn't typical, I'm not lazy or dumb, I'm just having a rough time. It's ok to slip up here and there and not be at 100% peak productivity, because I'm doing my best and I'm getting stuff done despite the challenges.\n\n---\n\n_This post was originally published on my (now defunct) blog on my portfolio site [ghall.dev](https://ghall.dev), and was republished here for archival purposes._","src/content/blog/2022/coding-with-depression.md","d2bf7a0999d48ac1",{"html":62,"metadata":63},"\u003Cp>One of the reasons I started this blog, aside from wanting to share my thoughts and experiences as someone early in my web development career, was to write about mental illness as it relates to development.

With nothing to do on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, which was a brisk 15°F, I decided I wanted to search through and try to find a rather lengthy retrospective I wrote on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now that I’ve finally started up a new blog I thought it would be fun to touch it up and republish it, since I put so many hours worth of work into it back in the day. Upsettingly, it was not there.\n\nBut I did find a rather salty post I wrote about a Mac theme I created back when I was a senior in high school. I thought it would be nice to go back and take a fresh look at the project, and how I feel about it now, being another 10 years removed from it.\n\nIf you were around the Mac customization scene–specifically on the now-defunct MacThemes.net–around 2007, you probably remember a little project called iLeopard. Admittedly, the chance that you’re in that extremely specific niché is incredibly small. The best data I could find is this [Ars Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/03/7296/) from March 2007 saying the Mac hit about 6% marketshare. And only a tiny subset of those users even had the thought that customizing the look of Mac OS X was something they wanted to do.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/ileopard/mac-os-10-1.png\" width=\"90%\" alt=\"a screenshot of Mac OS X 10.1 with various apps open\" />\n\n*Mac OS X 10.1 and the Aqua Interface, from* [_GUIdebook_](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/macosx101)\n\nI was one of the few that had that had that idea pop into my head. I was super into finding and downloading cool themes, including one I distinctly remember that looked like Windows Vista for some reason. It was 2007, the Aqua Interface (the playful, plastic-looking interface style Apple used for about a decade) was already feeling a little passé to me. I wanted something new, and weirdly enough that new thing came from Apple, in the form of iTunes 7.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/ileopard/itunes-7.gif\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"a screenshot iTunes 7 with the iTunes Music Store open\" />\n\n_iTunes 7 screenshot, from [AppleInsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/06/09/12/apple_introduces_itunes_7_previews_itv_device)_\n\nIn retrospect, and with the hindsight of 15 years of UI design evolution, it’s not exactly pretty, but I liked it at the time. It was classy, and simple, and I thought it was the future of the Mac OS X design language.\n\nFast-forward to the release of Mac OS X Leopard, and I was disappointed to see that the bubbly, lick-able scrollbars and buttons were still quite prominent. Having dabbled in the Mac OS X theming scene already, I decided to take matters into my own hands.\n\nThere was a small problem though. With the release of Leopard, Apple changed the format the system used for UI resources, and introduced a new framework to power it all, called CoreUI. The tools that had existed to make theming the OS relatively simple were useless.\n\nIf you’re curious, [here’s a writeup](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/10/) from John Siracusa’s Mac OS X Leopard review about CoreUI, which was, if I recall, what served as the starting point on the road to being able to even locate the system files I needed to crack open.\n\nNow, just as a heads up, most of what follows is based on memory and a fairly cringy blog post I wrote 10 years ago and found in the bowls of my digital archives. Also, my memory on the timeline is a bit fuzzy, but with some digging I found that this mostly takes place between April and June 2008.\n\nBasically, the main barrier to theming Mac OS X Leopard were 2 files; ArtFile.bin, and SArtFile.bin. This is where nearly all the UI resources were stored, aside from scroll bars, which were stored in a file called Extras.rsrc, a file that had been cracked ages before. If I recall–and I could be totally wrong so if anybody knows better feel free to tell me–Extras.rsrc, and its sister file Extras2.rsrc, still contained all the UI resources, but only the scrollbars were actually used by the system.\n\nI want to make it clear that I can’t take the credit for cracking open ArtFile.bin and SArtFile.bin. I believe it was someone on the MacThemes.net forum, and I wish I could remember or find their name–if you’re out there reading this, thank you! Those files were essentially encrypted ZIP files, and this genius of a human build a command line tool to decrypt and extract them. This was actually the experience that got me comfortable with the command line, and we’ll say indirectly led to my current career as a web developer, but I digress…\n\nAnyway, I knew where to find the files. I had the tool to decrypt the files. The only thing that stood in my way was the mass of nonsensical folder names filled with equally nonsensically named bitmap images that got extracted from the files.\n\nBeing that I was a bored teenager in high school with way too much time on my hands, I decided to figure out exactly what every bitmap image was by methodically changing the graphics to the most garish colors I could, recreating the bin files–which if I recall was as easy as zipping them up and renaming them, but this was 15 years ago so I could definitely be misremembering–restarting my computer, and hunting down the various neon hues while taking notes.\n\nAfter dozens of restarts, and a couple corrupted OS installs, I had figured out a good chunk of the building blocks making up Leopard’s UI. Even still, after weeks of this, there was still so much to be done. Bear in mind, there was no documentation on any of this stuff. I was about to create, as far as I know, the first theme for Mac OS X Leopard.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/ileopard/ileopard-2-0-1.png\" width=\"75%\" alt=\"a screenshot of the Mac OS X Appearance preference pane showing off the modifications made by iLeopard\" />\n\n_iLeopard 2.0.1 screenshot, from [AmazingHenry on MacRumors](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ileopard-theme.2045553/), released by fellow MacThemes.net user ‘gcamp' after I essentially handed off the project_\n\nI started pulling elements from iTunes, and, using a “totally legal, I swear” copy of Adobe PhotoShop, tweaked them to fit in their new home. I shared the very first version of the theme, which I called iLeopard, a portmanteau of iTunes and Leopard, on the MacThemes.net forum (thankfully archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080702015727/http://macthemes2.net:80/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16785679&p=1) by the Wayback Machine!!), and it kind of took off more than I expected. By that, I mean people actually used it. Then it made the MacThemes.net front page. Yeah, it was all a bit overwhelming.\n\nAt some point, I got an offer to help out with the theme from fellow forum user ‘gcamp’. This was probably the best possible thing to happen for the longevity of the theme. He initially started by contributing custom graphics, and ended up taking the reigns on the project after I graduated high school and lost my passion for the project. He kept the project alive, I believe until Apple effectively killed Mac theming for good a few releases later.\n\nThe sad news is I lost all my original work on iLeopard, along with countless other digital relics from that era of my life, when my MacBook suffered a major hard drive crash in 2011. I had to go on a crazy archeological dig through the internet just to find the above screenshot, and it’s from after I handed off the project.

I’m very introverted and socially anxious, so dating apps seemed like the way to go for me. Sadly, I’ve not had a lot of success, and since Covid it seems like the dating scene has only got worse. I’ve been feeling pretty down about it, but I decided to have a little fun and let an AI help me assemble a brand new profile.\n\nMy goal is to, for an entire week, use my AI generated dating profile. That means my bio and prompts would be written by an AI and all my photos would be selected by an AI. Finally, as long as it doesn’t end in disaster, all my opening messages will be generated by an AI–all further responses will be written by me, because otherwise what would be the point?\n\nI decided to use [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for the written portion, and [Everypixel](https://aesthetics.everypixel.com/) to select the pictures. For the dating app itself, the most important ingredient in this experiment, I decided to go with [Hinge](https://hinge.co/), mainly because I've never used it before.\n\nI decided against using AI generated images because, even though I’m letting an AI create a dating profile for me, I want it to be somewhat genuine. Also I’m not looking to catfish anybody with this image I generated just to see how good AI could make me look:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/my-ai-portrait.jpg\" width=\"260\" alt=\"an AI-generated portrait of me\" />\n\nOriginally this was going to be one post I’d write over the course of a week, but as I was writing I decided I should split it into 2 parts: Part 1, this part, about setting up the dating profile, and part 2, coming at the end of the experiment, about the experience and how it went.\n\nMy first step was to sign up for Hinge. I went through the sign up process, and got to photos. Hinge requires 6 photos to create a profile, so it was Everypixel’s time to shine! I collected up 42 photos from the last few years—I wasn’t aiming for 42 but, as that’s the answer to life, the universe, and everything, I decided to take it as a good omen—and proceeded to feed them through this AI (which I have no doubt added to some collection of images to train machine learning algorithms. Your welcome for the coming robot apocalypse!).\n\nMy first photo didn’t go over very well, with a whopping 0.9% chance of being awesome. Oh well, 41 more pictures to go. After going through the first 5 photos, not a single one scored more than 8%. That’s when I noticed I could get more info about the result, and found this gem: “Surprised by the result? This service doesn't measure the coolness or beauty of a person or any object in a photo.”\n\nSo really all I learned was that my selfies and family photos are garbage. Good to know.\n\nI had to go back to the drawing board. I came across [AttractivenessTest.com](http://AttractivenessTest.com) which admittedly seems more dubious than Everypixel, but sometimes we gotta make sacrifices. Anyways, it seemed to go pretty well, but there was one photo I had to disqualify because the AI kept zeroing in on someone else's face, and 3 that it absolutely refused to process, most likely because it couldn't zero in on my face.\n\nAs I ran through the photos, I sorted them into folders based on the rating they got, from 1 to 10. I don’t mean to brag, but I got a couple 7’s. The problem though was I had 12 6’s, so I couldn’t simply combine these 2 categories so I decided to go back to our old friend Everypixel to pick the top 4 best photos of the ones rated 6. Within a few minutes I had my top 4, ranging from a 1.5% chance to 50% chance to be awesome. Quite a range, and not extremely encouraging but that’s the bed I’ve made for myself.\n\nInteresting note: what I consider the 2 best pictures of me with animals made it through the process and made it to the top 6.\n\nNext up was selecting and answering prompts. While not remotely AI, I decided it best to use a random number generator to help me select which prompts the AI should answer.\n\nThis is where I ran into my first major roadblock. Through the magic of random numbers, for the first prompt I landed on, “Give me travel tips for…” The AI, predictably, gave me some admittedly useful travel tips, but I’m not sure that was in the spirit of the prompt. I decided it best to remove the random factor and hand-select 3 prompts I think the AI might be able to handle.\n\nMy first selection was, “The hallmark of a good relationship is…” Boy did it deliver!\n\n> The hallmark of a good relationship is trust, respect, and open communication. When two people are in a relationship, they should be able to have honest and meaningful conversations, with enough understanding, patience, and empathy to make sure that both perspectives can be heard. A good relationship should also be based on mutual respect, with each person being able to express themselves and their feelings without feeling judged or belittled. Lastly, having a strong foundation of trust and honesty is essential for a healthy and fulfilling relationship.\n\nSadly, it was a little long but with a little bit of trimming I got it to fit into the 220-character limit.\n\nNext up I picked, “The key to my heart is…” To which the AI responded, weirdly in context with the previous prompt, with the following:\n\n> No single \"key\" can unlock a person's heart. The best way forward is to build a relationship based on the qualities mentioned above.\n\nFinally, I picked, “My best dad joke.” The AI did not disappoint.\n\n> Q: What did the sea say to the beach?\n>\n> A: Nothing, it just waved!\n\nWhen I was experimenting with OpenAI initially, I had it prepare a short bio. Unfortunately, it seems that Hinge doesn’t have a field for a bio, but here it is anyway, for posterity.\n\n> I'm an introverted geek who loves all things tech, sci-fi, and fantasy. I enjoy staying inside watching movies, playing video games, and reading comics. I'm looking for someone who shares my interests and is up for some exciting nerd-related activities. I'm a reliable and loyal person who loves to make people laugh. I'm also an animal lover and I like to spend time with cats and dogs. If you think we could be a great match, let's get to know each other better!\n\nSo, how well will this work? Will AI turn my love life around? Or will this backfire spectacularly? Nobody knows! But I’ll be sure to follow up in part 2. 🙂","src/content/blog/2022/creating-a-dating-profile-with-ai.md","cd44821db46d1ab3",{"html":104,"metadata":105},"\u003Cp>I’ve been single for a few years now, and I haven’t had a whole lot of success in the dating game.

When two people are in a relationship, they should be able to have honest and meaningful conversations, with enough understanding, patience, and empathy to make sure that both perspectives can be heard. A good relationship should also be based on mutual respect, with each person being able to express themselves and their feelings without feeling judged or belittled. Lastly, having a strong foundation of trust and honesty is essential for a healthy and fulfilling relationship.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Sadly, it was a little long but with a little bit of trimming I got it to fit into the 220-character limit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Next up I picked, “The key to my heart is…” To which the AI responded, weirdly in context with the previous prompt, with the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>No single “key” can unlock a person’s heart. The best way forward is to build a relationship based on the qualities mentioned above.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Finally, I picked, “My best dad joke.” The AI did not disappoint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Q: What did the sea say to the beach?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A: Nothing, it just waved!\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>When I was experimenting with OpenAI initially, I had it prepare a short bio. Unfortunately, it seems that Hinge doesn’t have a field for a bio, but here it is anyway, for posterity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>I’m an introverted geek who loves all things tech, sci-fi, and fantasy. I enjoy staying inside watching movies, playing video games, and reading comics. I’m looking for someone who shares my interests and is up for some exciting nerd-related activities. I’m a reliable and loyal person who loves to make people laugh. I’m also an animal lover and I like to spend time with cats and dogs.

Thankfully, Tunic is one I managed to finish.\n\nIt came at just the right time, I had just wrapped up Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and I was in the modo for a light action-adventure game.

Even simple things like how to upgrade your stats isn't explained to you in plain terms.\n\n### Horizon Forbidden West\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn launched in a crowded year for good games, but it stood out to me for its incredibly engrossing story, and its primary mechanic of fighting giant friggin' robots. I was captivated from the start, and was chomping at the bit for a sequel. That sequel finally came, and once again got buried by other games (yeah, I'm looking at you, Elden Ring).

We've seen such an influx of quality titles that it's been hard to even keep track, or even dedicate the time to the ones I have been able to keep track of. One of the two games that has really captured my attention – the other being Tears of the Kingdom – is Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nI’ve typically have had a difficult time getting invested in deep, Western-made RPGs, with the notable exception of The Witcher 3. The specific sub-genre that Baldur’s Gate 3 belongs to, the CRPG (or, Computer Role Playing Game) has been particularly challenging for me to latch on to.\n\nAround late-2020 or early-2021 I started playing Dungeons and Dragons remotely with a couple internet friends. It was in the midst of Covid, so we all had too much time to kill, and would spend a good chunk of our Sundays adventuring across the Forgotten Realms. I’d played D&D before, but it wasn’t something I really got into until that point.\n\nIf I didn’t have this experience I don’t think I would have been open to playing Baldur’s Gate. Because its mechanics are based on the same D&D rules I had spent hours immersed in every Sunday for nearly a year, I was going into the game already knowing the mechanics I usually find overwhelming and obtuse in these types of games.\n\nFor my first playthrough, I decided to port my wood elf ranger, the character I played as in the aforementioned remote D&D campaigns. I tried to recreate him as closely as the game allowed – Baldur’s Gate 3 actually uses a slightly modified version of the current D&D ruleset – and tried to role-play him the same. Basically my head canon was, after his previous adventures, he was thrust into this story.\n\nI never actually finished this playthrough. I got to the final story quest and decided to start over, I’d made so many mistakes, missed out on 3 major companions (Wyll, Karlach, and Halsin), and was only just getting comfortable with the freedom the game offers. Maybe someday I’ll finish my plucky wood elf’s journey, but until then...\n\nFor my second character, I chose to play as the Dark Urge. Unlike a purely custom character like I used for my first playthrough, the Dark Urge is not a blank slate, and has a story that interlinks with the game’s overall story.\n\nFor the Dark Urge I went with a human rogue, and I’ve had a lot more fun leaning into the game’s mechanics this time around. She’s basically a badass assassin, a master of deception, who disguises herself using this magical mask – which I got as part of the deluxe edition – to reach her targets.\n\nThis subtly altered my approach to the game in more ways than I had anticipated. For instance, during the early stages of the game, there's a quest to infiltrate a goblin camp and eliminate their three leaders. On both occasions, I successfully gained entry by persuading the goblins that I belonged to the nefarious cult that plays a significant role in the story. The first attempt required passing a series of deception checks, while during the second attempt, I employed the aforementioned magical mask to transform my character into a Drow – a race of dark elves – allowing me to waltz right into the camp.\n\nCarrying out the quest to take out the 3 goblin leaders played out quite a bit differently, at least on a mechanical level. The first time around I went in guns (er, arrows) blazing to take out the first 2 leaders, and then somehow convincing the 3rd I was on her side, leading her to a Druid grove, and having an all-out battle.\n\nThe second time I took full advantage of my party’s range of capabilities at that point, as well as the environment, to ambush the 3 leaders and get out with as little damage to my team as possible. I had a much easier time using this method, but it was so much more fulfilling to pull off. It didn’t feel cheap because I wasn’t cheesing the mechanics, I was figuring out how to best use them to my advantage.\n\nOn the surface, Baldur’s Gate 3 seems to share very little in common with Tears of the Kingdom, but I think it has enraptured me in much the same way. Both games not only allow you to push their mechanics to the limit to find your own solutions to the challenges they present you, but they make doing so extremely rewarding. These are games that are at their best when you think outside the box and get creative with the tools they give you.\n\nLast year I wrote about [my 3 favorite games of 2022](/posts/2022/my-top-3-games-of-2022) with the intention of doing a similar thing this year, but I don’t think I can. I’ve played a few games that could be the 3rd game in a potential “3 Favorite Games of 2023”, Sea of Stars, Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor come to mind, and while they’re all very good games worthy of the spot, they just didn't come close to impacting me in the same way.\n\nTears of the Kingdom [gave me a place to feel at home](/posts/2023/finding-home-in-hyrule) at a time when I felt out of place after moving apartments. Baldur’s Gate 3 has given me a sense of camaraderie, albeit a virtual one, in a point in my life when I’ve been feeling alone and lost trying to find myself in a new city.

Coincidentally, a little game called The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom dropped the day before I was to embark on this IRL adventure.\n\nMy first night in the new place involved staying up well past midnight diving into Hyrule once again, but this time it brought be a different kind of comfort. Fortuitously for me, Nintendo decided to reuse the world map from the previous game and just build upon it, and that has made this game feel a lot like coming home to me. Hyrule was a world that got me through a rough point in my life, and here it is again giving me a little taste of familiarity, of home, at a time when I need it the most.\n\nLast night I made a point to find a place Hateno Village, a town where you can buy a little house in Breath of the Wild. I wanted to visit it again, and see what had become of this virtual home-away-from-home.

As someone with mental health struggles, I appreciate the recent efforts Apple has put into making these kinds of features available, so I was really excited to take a look at this latest addition.\n\nFirst off, I like the simplicity of the interface.

It even offers you journaling prompt which is excellent for those like me who are not always sure what to write about.

It’s pretty barebones, but I think that’s ok. The one thing I would like is the ability to tie into the mood tracking on Apple Watch and either be able to set your current mood from the app, or tie mood tracking into the Journaling Suggestions feature.\n\nSpeaking of, I actually don’t have much to say about the Journaling Suggestions feature. At the moment it can only suggest journaling based on your workouts, music and podcasts, messages and calls you make, your photos, and significant locations. That’s not at all how I like to journal, so I actually have those turned off. Apparently there’s an API that 3rd party apps can use, but we won’t see what that will bring until iOS 17.2 officially comes out later this year.\n\nSome other things I like are the ability to lock your journal with its own password, which I think is an absolute must for this kind of app, and the ability to set a journal schedule, which is nice for helping to build – or rebuild – a regular journaling habit.\n\nThe one thing I do not like, and this could be the dealbreaker for me, is that, at the moment, Journal is iPhone only. No iPad, no Mac, just iPhone. This severely limits its usability for me, I generally do not like writing anything more than a sentence or 2 on an iPhone.

Mostly Star Trek, some Star Wars, and 1 or 2 model planes. It was sort of a continuation of my Lego obsession from my pre-teen days, but at some point I just kind of fell of. Fast-forward Summer 2022, I was going through a rough patch and wanted to focus on some hobbies that would get me away from the screen, and I decided to pick up model building again.

Best I can understand is that it's a portmanteau of [Gundam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam) and plastic. So simply put, it's about building robots (sorry, mecha) out of plastic.\n\nI've never been a Gundam fan, the genre just never really appealed to me. But I became enamored with watching Gunpla videos on YouTube, which is a whole genre of ASMR-like videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq88NAAD25k). The level of engineering behind these kits was just so fascinating to me, but I'm not super big on buying merch for franchises I don't really enjoy. Happily, that ended up not being a problem.\n\nSo, there was a little anime I watched back in high school called [Full Metal Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Panic!) which, like Gundam, features people piloting giant mecha. As luck would have it, Bandai, the makers of Gunpla kits, have/had the license to make kits for the series. Not-so-luckily, the kit I wanted based on the main character's mech is impossible to find at a reasonable price at the moment, so I settled for my second pick:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/gunpla/box.jpg\" width=\"90%\" alt=\"a box sitting on a table with an image of a mech and text that reads 'M9 Gernsback ver IV (Agressor Squadron)'\" />\n\nSo, with the kit in hand, I opened the box and was greeted by a handful of plastic pouches containing what seemed like a thousand parts connected on plastic sprues in a variety of blues and grays. I took out the contents and perused through the included instructions, which read very much like it was designed by Ikea, if Ikea sold miniature giant robots. The writing was all in Japanese, but the illustrations were enough to guide one through the process no matter what language they can read.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/gunpla/all-the-parts.jpg\" width=\"90%\" alt=\"neatly piled plastic sprues sorted by color, an instruction booklet, and a model of R2-D2 lurking in the corner\" />\n\nSeparating the individual pieces from each sprue was pretty painless. They came off very cleanly and I barely had to use my handy hobby knife to clean up bits of excess plastic, and when I did it cut through like butter. Not a drop of glue was needed, everything snapped together perfectly. I struggled a bit with the smaller parts (of which there were plenty), and there were a couple seemingly microscopic stickers I had to apply, so my iFixIt tweezers came in handy quite a few times.\n\nAfter a couple hours, I had a pretty sweet looking miniature mecha.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/gunpla/final.jpg\" width=\"90%\" alt=\"the finished model, standing tall, and holding a scary looking gun\" />\n\nPutting it together, I was just so amazed by the level of engineering that went into this kit. Putting it all together, I could tell someone put a lot of care and attention into designing this thing, rivaling some of the Lego kits I've built, from the near-seamless fit of all the pieces, to the various types of joints enabling a quite frankly insane level of pose-ability for something this size.\n\nI had a lot of fun doing this, and it was cool to see what this little subculture of model building is like. Would I build another one? For sure, but I don't think it will be a regular thing for me because of how expensive it could get. This kit cost me around $50, and I tend to go hard on stuff like this (see my obscene collection of 2016-2017-era Magic The Gathering cards), so I could see myself spending way too much money on this if I'm not careful.\n\nI'm sure I'll get another kit eventually, but in the meantime there's a seemingly infinite number of those ASMR-style assembly videos, so I can marvel at the the engineering behind these kits second-hand for now.","src/content/blog/2023/my-gunpla-adventure.md","0151531fdef3e9eb",{"html":333,"metadata":334},"\u003Cp>Back in my teenage years I used to build model kits.

In order to access the API, an app first needs to authenticate with their server by sending a pair of authentication keys and receiving back a special “bearer token”. This token can then be used to access the API itself, but as a developer my app can only request a very limited number of tokens at a time across all instances. That’s not a problem if you have only a couple users, but it could become one very quickly if say I had even 50 people using my app. So the best way around that is to set up a proxy server for the app to communicate with instead, and essentially let all users share the same token.\n\nI was feeling super discouraged.

As a web developer who’s recently started dabbling in Swift, and building apps for Apple platforms, I’m excited to see what gets shown off that I can start sinking my teeth into. On the other hand, as a longtime Mac user, I’m a little apprehensive about what we’ll see there.\n\nHardware-wise, the Mac is in a fantastic place. We’re 3 years into the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon, and the design aesthetic is changing up for the first time in like a decade (maybe more??). However, in terms of software, specifically macOS itself, we’re kind of in a weird place.\n\nJust looking at macOS 13 Ventura, the latest version until the next one is most likely announced tomorrow, there are so many little oddities that range from minor annoyances to showstoppers. Some bugs introduced in the betas from last year, for example the infamous launch item notification bug, are _still_ present in the currently shipping version (13.4). Then there’s the mess that is System Settings, which received a major redesign last year for the first time since the Mac OS X betas from 23 years ago.\n\nThen there are some long-standing issues, like a memory leak in the WindowServer system process that has existed since at least Monterey in 2021 (though I feel like I’ve been experiencing it longer). Or the fact that the TV app straight up doesn’t work most of the time.\n\nThen there’s Launchpad (which may not be long for this world as the dedicated key on Apple’s keyboard has been replaced with Spotlight) which I’ve tried to use since it was introduced in Mac OS X Lion all the way back in 2010, but has a bug that will randomly just reorder the icons, which has been an issue since day 1.\n\nOne other long-standing issue that I’ve experienced is how unreliable network drives are. I have a Mac Mini set up as a home server, and the amount of times it’ll just fail to connect when I need to access one of the drives, or Time Machine just fails to recognize that there’s a network volume, is exceedingly frustrating.\n\nThe reliability of macOS varies so much from person to person. Some people experience just one, or maybe even none, of the issues I’ve mentioned. Others experience totally different issues that I’ve never run into. It’s just so wild that an operating system that has been around for 23 years (33 if you count NeXTSTEP as part of the lineage) has so many little issues. Yes, every piece of software has bugs, especially when working with the bogglingly large codebase of an operating system, but so many of what people encounter on the Mac are not small issues.\n\nAll this to say, my one wish for WWDC 2023 is that we _don’t_ see a new version of macOS, and if we do, it’s purely focused on fixing the outstanding issues (and, if we want to get really crazy, fixing the System Settings design).

I decided to try and experiment with combining [MUI Base](https://mui.com/base/getting-started/overview/), the barebones version of the MUI library, with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to allow easier customization. Here's an overview of how I set up a test project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This writeup assumes you have some experience with Next.js, using the terminal, and ideally some experience with MUI and Tailwind.\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Next.js\n\nNothing special is going on here. You can use `npx create-next-app@latest` or `yarn create next-app` depending on which package manager you prefer. I personally like Yarn, so that's what I'll be using. If you use NPM though the commands are similar so you'll be able to follow along.\n\nFollow the prompts to set up your Next.js project. These are the choices I went with:\n\n- Project name: mui-tailwind\n- Typescript: No\n- ESLint: Yes\n- Use 'src/' directory: Yes\n- Experimental 'app/' directory: No\n\nI also chose not to set up any import aliases for now. These can be easily added later if you so choose.\n\nIt will take a few moments for Next.js to download and for the project to set up, but when that's done, cd into '/mui-tailwind' (or whatever you named the project).\n\n## Step 2: Install MUI Base & Tailwind\n\nInstalling MUI Base is simple. Just run `yarn add @mui/base`, and you're good to go. There will be some config to do later, but once the package is done installing we're ready to install Tailwind with `yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`.\n\nOnce both MUI Base and Tailwind are installed, we next need to run `yarn tailwindcss init -p`, which will create 2 files, one called 'tailwind.config.js', and another called 'postcss.config.js'. Now we're ready to do some setup.\n\n## Step 3: Configuration\n\nFirst thing's first, open up the project folder in your code editor of choice and at the root of the project you should see the 'tailwind.config.js' we created in step 2. Open that, and under `module.exports` you should see an empty array named 'content'. Add the following to the array: `'./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'` Your config file should look like this:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/tailwind-config.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"module.exports = { content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [],};\">\n\nNext, we need to import Tailwind into our 'globals.css' file, which is located in 'src/styles/'. We can delete everything in the file as we won't be needing any of it. Then, add the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/global-css.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;\">\n\nAnd that's it! We're ready to start creating something!\n\n## Step 4: Creating Your First Component\n\nIdeally, we'd want to create smaller, reusable component files, but that's beyond the scope of this post, and is something you're most likely already familiar with if you have any experience with Next.js. Instead, we're going to work entirely in 'src/pages/index.js'.\n\nFirst, we should delete everything we don't need so that our 'index.js' file looks like this:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/index-js.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"export default function Home() { return() }\">\n\nWe're going to create a simple button, nothing too fancy. So first we need to import the MUI Unstyled Button component by adding `import { ButtonUnstyled as Button } from '@mui/base'` on the first line of our file.\n\n_Note: The official MUI docs say to import as `import ButtonUnstyled from '@mui/base/ButtonUnstyled'`, which also works, but I prefer to use destructing which allows you to import multiple components with a single import statement'_\n\nNow we can create our button. Inside the return statement, add the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/unstyled-button-code.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"\u003CButton>Click Me!\u003C/Button>\" />\n\nNext, go back to your terminal and run `yarn dev` to start up the dev server, and click the 'localhost' link that appears (most likely 'localhost:3000'). We'll be greeted by what looks like just a bit of text (it's a button, I promise), which isn't what we want, but that's because we haven't added any styles yet!\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/unstyled-button.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"A plain old 'button' that reads 'Click Me!'\" />\n\nAll we need to do is add the `className` prop with some nice Tailwind utility classes:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/styled-button-code.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"\u003CButton className='rounded-lg border-2 border-sky-500 bg-sky-600 py-2 px-10 font-medium text-slate-300 shadow hover:bg-sky-700 active:translate-y-0.5'>\n  Click Me!\n\u003C/Button>\" />\n\nNow, when we go back to the browser, we should see the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/styled-button.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"A styled blue button that reads 'Click Me!'\" />\n\nNice! That looks a lot more like a button.\n\n## Step 5: Further Reading\n\nThis tutorial is just the basics of setting up a project using Next.js, MUI Base, and Tailwind. Of course, there's so much more to all these tools than I can possibly cover.

Not on jobs, the economy, or even the damage it’s done to our ability to trust information we see online (whether it’s something generated by a malicious actor looking to mislead, or a simple “hallucination” causing an innocent mistake). No, I’ve been pondering its effects on human creativity, and our capacity to learn and grow as creative creatures. This is something I’ve had in the back of my mind for a quite a while, and I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can put my feelings into words.\n\nMy experience with generative AI started way back at the end of 2022 with [an AI-assisted dating profile](https://ghall.blog/posts/2022/creating-a-dating-profile-with-ai/). Just over a month later, I posted a [follow up](https://ghall.blog/posts/2023/an-update-on-my-ai-dating-profile/), in which I said the following:\n\n> …it didn’t feel like I was presenting my authentic self. Yes, I vetted the text generated by the AI to ensure it wasn’t falsely representing me, but I still felt dirty. Like the few matches I did get weren’t matching with me, but with the AI. My profile may have been technically accurate to who I am as a person, but I felt somewhat removed from it.\n\nI’ve used AI on and off for different reasons since then. I’ve used it to help solve programming issues at work and on side projects, to generate images in various art styles that I don’t have the patience or talent to draw in, and even tinkered with it for writing letters. But I kept experiencing the same feelings I had from “creating” my AI dating profile; these creations were far more a product of the machine than my own humanity.\n\nIt can be–and has been–argued that generative AI democratizes creativity. A person who can barely draw a stick figure can create intricate works of art just by writing some words and feeding them into an algorithm. Or someone with no sense of rhythm or tune can make music that sounds clean and professional. As someone who lacks skill in both those areas (and many more), that sounds incredibly liberating.\n\nBut, the more I think about it, even when ignoring the plagiarism inherent in using generative AI, the more problematic it feels. Yes, generative AI is a tool like any other, and requires a human to operate it[^1], but at what point does a tool eclipse the creative input of the human behind it?\n\nArt, writing, any sort of creative output, is the result of our emotions, our thoughts, our experiences. Perhaps even more important is the journey we must take to create. We can’t be good at everything, and part of the joy of creation is finding the things that we can be good at, and honing that skill. The best painters in history didn’t wake up one day and start making masterpieces, the best writers didn’t start writing classics from the moment they put pen to paper, and the best photographers weren’t masters of framing when they picked up a camera for the first time.\n\nI would argue that Generative AI does not democratize art or self-expression. It enables us to create a hollow facsimile of those things, something that doesn’t truly express to the world who we are. If an AI wrote my blog posts, they might convey some broad thought or opinion I may share, but you wouldn’t be any closer to understanding how I truly feel about whatever it is I’m writing about.\n\nWhy does any of this even matter? Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t. But, I would argue that, whether it’s commercial art or just art for the sake of art, a personal blog or a best-selling novel, a side project or just a small piece of a larger piece of software, it’s the human element, the emotions and experiences of the creator, that makes any art worth creating or consuming.\n\nGenerative AI is already writing articles for publications like Sports Illustrated, creating motion graphics for shows like Marvel’s Secret Invasion, and being pushed into countless tools for creatives, developers, and designers. Even Apple, which has prided itself for decades on making products that appeal to artists, has got into the generative AI game with their upcoming Image Playground app.\n\nNone of this is to say AI has no place in our lives–I for one would love an AI to do my taxes, create meal plans, and handle whatever other drudgery we need to deal with. Like any tool, it should supplement, not replace, the human touch.\n\nThe question I think we need to ponder is this; Where do we draw the line?\n\nSurely, purely AI-generated works are a bridge too far. But is there room for AI to assist in the creative process, and to what extent? How do we strike a balance and use this tool in a way that maximizes its positive impact on our lives while minimizing the negative impact on society? I hope that this is a question we can answer as a society sooner than later…\n\n[^1]: For now, anyway… _Cue dramatic music_. 🎵","src/content/blog/2024/ai-and-creativity.md","58d356fe670a1a7d",{"html":514,"metadata":515},"\u003Cp>Recently, I’ve been pondering generative AI and its effects. Not on jobs, the economy, or even the damage it’s done to our ability to trust information we see online (whether it’s something generated by a malicious actor looking to mislead, or a simple “hallucination” causing an innocent mistake). No, I’ve been pondering its effects on human creativity, and our capacity to learn and grow as creative creatures. This is something I’ve had in the back of my mind for a quite a while, and I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can put my feelings into words.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My experience with generative AI started way back at the end of 2022 with \u003Ca href=\"https://ghall.blog/posts/2022/creating-a-dating-profile-with-ai/\">an AI-assisted dating profile\u003C/a>. Just over a month later, I posted a \u003Ca href=\"https://ghall.blog/posts/2023/an-update-on-my-ai-dating-profile/\">follow up\u003C/a>, in which I said the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>…it didn’t feel like I was presenting my authentic self. Yes, I vetted the text generated by the AI to ensure it wasn’t falsely representing me, but I still felt dirty. Like the few matches I did get weren’t matching with me, but with the AI. My profile may have been technically accurate to who I am as a person, but I felt somewhat removed from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>I’ve used AI on and off for different reasons since then. I’ve used it to help solve programming issues at work and on side projects, to generate images in various art styles that I don’t have the patience or talent to draw in, and even tinkered with it for writing letters. But I kept experiencing the same feelings I had from “creating” my AI dating profile; these creations were far more a product of the machine than my own humanity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It can be–and has been–argued that generative AI democratizes creativity. A person who can barely draw a stick figure can create intricate works of art just by writing some words and feeding them into an algorithm. Or someone with no sense of rhythm or tune can make music that sounds clean and professional. As someone who lacks skill in both those areas (and many more), that sounds incredibly liberating.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But, the more I think about it, even when ignoring the plagiarism inherent in using generative AI, the more problematic it feels. Yes, generative AI is a tool like any other, and requires a human to operate it\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>, but at what point does a tool eclipse the creative input of the human behind it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Art, writing, any sort of creative output, is the result of our emotions, our thoughts, our experiences. Perhaps even more important is the journey we must take to create. We can’t be good at everything, and part of the joy of creation is finding the things that we can be good at, and honing that skill. The best painters in history didn’t wake up one day and start making masterpieces, the best writers didn’t start writing classics from the moment they put pen to paper, and the best photographers weren’t masters of framing when they picked up a camera for the first time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would argue that Generative AI does not democratize art or self-expression. It enables us to create a hollow facsimile of those things, something that doesn’t truly express to the world who we are. If an AI wrote my blog posts, they might convey some broad thought or opinion I may share, but you wouldn’t be any closer to understanding how I truly feel about whatever it is I’m writing about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why does any of this even matter? Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t. But, I would argue that, whether it’s commercial art or just art for the sake of art, a personal blog or a best-selling novel, a side project or just a small piece of a larger piece of software, it’s the human element, the emotions and experiences of the creator, that makes any art worth creating or consuming.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Generative AI is already writing articles for publications like Sports Illustrated, creating motion graphics for shows like Marvel’s Secret Invasion, and being pushed into countless tools for creatives, developers, and designers. Even Apple, which has prided itself for decades on making products that appeal to artists, has got into the generative AI game with their upcoming Image Playground app.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>None of this is to say AI has no place in our lives–I for one would love an AI to do my taxes, create meal plans, and handle whatever other drudgery we need to deal with. Like any tool, it should supplement, not replace, the human touch.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The question I think we need to ponder is this; Where do we draw the line?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Surely, purely AI-generated works are a bridge too far. But is there room for AI to assist in the creative process, and to what extent? How do we strike a balance and use this tool in a way that maximizes its positive impact on our lives while minimizing the negative impact on society?

It got me thinking about some of my most formative video game experiences, and what shaped me into the gamer I am today.\n\nLike the postcast, I've picked 5 games I consider to be important to me personally. They're in no particular order, and they're not all my favorites, but they are the games that contributed most to my love of gaming.\n\n## Donkey Kong Country\n\nThis game hold a special place in my heart as my first ever video game. When I was 6, my dad bought me a Super Nintendo bundled with this game, and it blew my little mind. While I think its sequel, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, is the better game, the original still has a warm place in my heart, and I revisit it from time to time.\n\n## Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was young, and I wasn't really allowed to have a console at my mom's house. I was, however, allowed to have my GameBoy, which my mom bought for me alongside a copy of this game.\n\nIt's not what I'd call a favorite of mine–sorry to everyone who loves this game–but it was my first experience with portable gaming, and the start of my preference for that kind of experience. And it eventually led to my next formative game...\n\n## Pokémon Red[^1]\n\nIf you're a gamer in your early-to-mid-30's, Pokémon is probably the game that introduced to you to the genre of role-playing games. That was definitely the case for me. I didn't know anything about RPGs, but I was just the right age for Pokémon fever and I had to play it.

Photos, school projects, personal projects, a bunch of terrible stories I wrote (to be fair, that last one wasn't a huge loss). It was then I decided to get serious about backing up, and scrounged up what little money I had at the time to buy a 500GB external drive.\n\nSince then, though my backup solution has evolved, I haven't lost a single bit of data. Outside of my own stupidity of course, but that's another story...\n\nMy current backup solution is 2-fold:\n\nFirst, my entire MacBook is backed up over my local network to an external 4TB drive connected to Mac Mini server using [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/).\n\nSecond, the Mac Mini server is then backed up to the cloud via [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/).\n\nTo complicate things a tad, I also have a 1TB external SSD connected to the Mac Mini which I use as extra storage for files I don't really need on my MacBook, but still want to keep. This SSD is also backed up to the 4TB drive (via another install of Carbon Copy Cloner), and is thus included in the Backblaze backup.\n\nI've opted to use Carbon Copy Cloner instead of Time Machine because it offers a lot more flexibility, both in scheduling and in how my backups are organized.\n\nFor example, the external SSD on the Mac Mini doesn't get written to a whole lot, so I have it scheduled to backup once a day. It's probably a little excessive for how often I actually need to save files there, but I figure it's better to backup more often than I actually need.\n\nOn my MacBook, I have it set to backup every 6 hours. I figured this was a good balance between safety and convenience. Most of my mission-critical work is code, which I commit to GitHub on a regular basis, and I'd rather not have to tie up my network every hour.\n\nFinally, I have both these backups separated into their own folders on the 4TB drive for organizational purposes, which I don't think is possible, or at least not that easy to set up, with Time Machine.\n\nBut my solution is not perfect, and I have identified a few weaknesses in my setup:\n\nFirstly, my backup is not bootable. This is more of a convenience than anything else, but because of how I have everything configured it's not possible to boot from my network backup.\n\nAlso, because my backups are over my local network, I can only backup from home. This isn't the end of the world since I don't often take my MacBook with me for more than a few hours but there have been instances where I've been away for a few days with it in tow. But again, it would be mostly an inconvenience because my mission-critical work gets pushed to GitHub regularly.\n\nThirdly, I don't have a great solution for keeping backups of my photos and anything else I have in iCloud. While both my local Photos library and the \"Mobile Documents\" folder–where macOS stores iCloud Drive locally–are included in the backup, the way iCloud handles files, and its overall reliability, makes me a little nervous. What if some of my photos are missing from the local library, or some document in my iCloud Drive isn't properly downloaded. I don't have a great solution to this, but I am open to suggestions. Please [hit me up on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ghalldev) if you have any.\n\nAnd finally, I don't have another offsite backup, so if my apartment burns down AND Backblaze for some reason loses all my data (which is an unlikely, but not impossible, scenario) I'm SOL.

Ever since I discovered Terminal.app in the Utilities folder on my PowerBook G4 back in the day, I've been curious about the kinds of things I could do with it. For most of that time, I've really only used it to change hidden settings, and run tools like 'diskutil', but since entering the world of software development the terminal has become an indispensable tool.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy about the terminal is how customizable it is. If you're on macOS like I am, it can be a nice little reprieve from the relatively locked-down GUI. As such, I've had a lot of fun tweaking the Unix underpinnings of the Mac to my own preferences.\n\n### The Basics\n\nTo start off, let's look at the basic setup. Though macOS comes with the built-in Terminal.app I mentioned earlier, I prefer to use an app called [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com). There are a lot of alternative terminal emulators out there, and I've tried most of them, but I keep coming back to iTerm because it just feels at home on the Mac in the way Warp, Alacritty, and the like, just don't.\n\nFor the shell itself, I use ZSH, which is what ships by default on Mac. I'll admit I'm not sure what the pros and cons are versus something like Bash, but it works for me. I also use [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) for an extra level of customization.\n\nFinally, I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for my package manager. That seems to be the go-to solution for Mac. I use it to not only install and manage the CLI tools I use, but also any GUI apps I install outside the App Store. There's even a nice little app called [Cork](https://github.com/buresdv/Cork) which is a GUI app that makes dealing with Homebrew a lot nicer.\n\n### Themes and Plugins\n\nUsing ohmyzsh opens the door for a lot of easy customization. One of the other tools I use is [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), which can be used with or without ohmyzsh. This allows you to create a theme by mixing and matching several preset options. I went with a pretty barebones, minimal look, but you don't have to go that route.\n\nFor plugins, I use [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete), which is basically a search function and autocompletion for terminal commands. I also use [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), which not only adds a bit of color, but can be useful as well because it will color code valid commands in green and invalid ones in red.\n\n### Useful Tools\n\nThere are also a handful of useful tools I have installed that make using the command line a much more pleasant experience. I'm going to skip over ones like git and Homebrew, they're pretty much a necessity for developers, and instead focus on some tools I'd consider nice to have.\n\nAll of these tools can be installed via Homebrew.\n\n**gum**\n\nThis isn't so much a standalone tool as it is a way to easily add some interactivity to shell scripts. You can easily add text inputs, confirmation dialogs, list selections, and even loading spinners to your shell scripts. There's a lot, so I'd suggest checking out [the readme](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum/blob/main/README.md) to see if it's something you'd find useful.\n\n**mas**\n\nA CLI for the Mac App Store. It may seem a little redundant, but I find it a much more reliable way to update apps installed via the App Store since auto-update seems pretty hit-or-miss, and many times updates will not show for me at all in the GUI interface. Simply running `mas upgrade` will find and install updates much more reliably in my experience.\n\n**thefuck**\n\nEven with all my autocomplete and syntax highlighting shenanigans, I still sometimes make mistakes (ever do a git push without setting an origin?). All I have to do when I make these silly mistakes is run the command `fuck` and it will pretty reliably find and run the command you meant to run.\n\n**yt-dlp**\n\nI don't always have to download YouTube videos, but when I do, I use yt-dlp. It makes it pretty simple to download videos, and it's feels a lot less sketchy than using one of those YouTube downloader websites. Shameless plug, I also [built a GUI front end for it](https://github.com/ghall89/Siphon).\n\n**zoxide**\n\nUsing cd to navigate our computers is an everyday part of using the terminal, but zoxide makes that experience much better. On top just being able to navigate your folders just like with cd, zoxide can keep track of your most visited folders and lets you quickly navigate to them with a fuzzy search. So, say you have a folder you navigate to a lot with `cd ~/Developer/web/personal/my-cool-blog`, instead of having to type that out you can simply type `z web blog` and it will, like magic, take you right there.

For 2023, Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3 blew me away that I couldn’t fathom selecting a third game that stood up to them. This year however, I’m returning to the originally envisioned format for my top 3 games of 2024.\n\nOne of my regrets from the 2022 post was that I didn’t go into very much detail as to why I liked the games, so this time around I wanted to make sure to go more in-depth (but not too in-depth). So, over the course of the year, I’ve kept a journal of every game I finished in 2024, and wrote down what I thought about it while the experience was still fresh in my mind. I chose this list by re-reading my journal and picking the 3 games that, upon reflection, still resonate with me in the same way.\n\n### Star Wars: Outlaws\n\nOk, this is a controversial pick, but, despite its many flaws, Star Wars: Outlaws is a game I genuinely enjoyed from start to finish. Granted, many of its strengths are a result of it being a Star Wars game, but as a fan of the franchise that’s enough for me.\n\nTo me, this game nailed the feeling of being a roguish scoundrel going on adventures across the Star Wars galaxy. From classic locations such as Mos Eisley, to new places like Mirogana, it all felt authentically a part of that galaxy far, far away. It’s clear the people behind the game are big fans of the universe George Lucas created.\n\nEven the typical Ubisoft open-world tropes didn’t detract from the experience. In fact, setting the game across multiple planets, and therefore segmenting the game into smaller open areas instead of one huge map, did a lot to remove the tedium that comes with open-world games.\n\nAnother aspect of the game I enjoyed was the “Reputation System”. During the course of the game you’ll encounter and do missions for various criminal syndicates; The Hutts, The Pykes, Crimson Dawn, and the Ashiga Clan. Which missions you do, and whether you succeed or fail, will affect your standing with these organizations. Raising your reputation with a particular group can unlock special merchants, allow you to take higher paying missions, and freely move about the gangs territory. However, betraying a gang, stealing from them, entering restricted areas, or just being a menace towards them, will lower your reputation. It’s a cool system, and I think it has plenty of room for iteration in a sequel.\n\n### Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\nI have to say, this is the game that most surprised me this year. While I enjoyed Final Fantasy VII Remake–the first entry in this trilogy-to-be of games re-imagining the classic 90’s RPG–when I originally played it during Covid lockdown in 2020, I found it very tedious when I revisited it a couple years ago In addition, 2023’s Final Fantasy XVI left me a bit down on the series as a whole. But I gave Rebirth a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did.\n\nOne thing this game shares in common with the first entry is how well it handles real-time combat, especially compared to the more recent “mainline” entries. Final Fantasy XV’s real-time combat was tedious, while XVI’s was frustrating and shallow. I really appreciate the ability in this game to switch characters in combat to not only keep gameplay interesting, but provide a level of depth and control that the aforementioned mainline games just don’t.\n\nThe world design, similar to Star Wars: Outlaws, is more segmented, which makes the exploration much less tedious, and far more varied. Each map is littered with side objectives to encourage exploration, but it’s not so much that it’s overwhelming. The only 2 exceptions were Cosmo Canyon and Gongaga, which I found extremely convoluted and not at all enjoyable to navigate.\n\nThe game has a multitude of mini-games, which felt like a throwback to an older style of video game design, and I thought it was fun. They weren’t all bangers, but I did find myself engaging in Gwen…sorry, I mean, Queen’s Blood. Also, Chocobo Racing ended up being another big time sink. It was enough to keep me coming back for many more hours, even after I finished the story (and is probably why I didn’t finish more games this year 😬).\n\n### The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom\n\nIt goes without saying, if there’s a new Zelda game out it’s going to make my top 3 games of the year, no question. Like any other game, it’s not perfect. As the first brand-new “2D” Zelda in a decade, and the first in the series to star the titular princess, it had high expectations to live up to, but I think it ran away with them.\n\nIt’s the first Zelda game of this style to take on the open-world design of the 2 most recent 3D games–Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom–and it really fit a lot better that I was expecting. In fact, I’d say it did the open-world much better, because it was reigned in just enough to not impede on the storytelling (such as it is in a Nintendo title), but still gave the player a good level of freedom to explore.\n\nAnother area this game excels is the puzzles. Much like in Tears of the Kingdom, the puzzles in this game are more focused on player creativity and finding fun solutions than simply trying to figure out the one solution the designers intended. Much of this creativity comes from what this game calls “echoes”, basically various objects and enemies you can conjure up.\n\nI hope this is a concept Nintendo revisits, because I really want to see a successor to this game that iterates upon what is already great, and improves on what didn’t quite work. Basically, what Tears of the Kingdom did for Breath of the Wild.","src/content/blog/2024/my-top-3-games-of-2024.md","aeb241061d662d08",{"html":673,"metadata":674},"\u003Cp>Back in December 2022, I wrote about \u003Ca href=\"/posts/2022/my-top-3-games-of-2022/\">my top 3 games of that year\u003C/a> in what I hoped would be a yearly tradition.

You've probably heard this a million times already this year, I'm pretty late to the party for writing a Macintosh retrospective, but I wanted to write this post anyway because of how important the Mac is to me. I might not be where I am today, especially not career-wise, if it weren't for the Macintosh.\n\nThat may seem like hyperbole, but it's really not.

I can't recall what originally caused me to become obsessed with this simple educational game, but I was hooked.\n\nSome of my earliest memories of actually tinkering with computers though came from having to spend time with my mom after work at a local university. This is where I discovered the Internet and network share drives. I remember finding a seemingly limitless repository of software and games-in retrospect, probably pirated-on the university network and taking whatever I could fit on a handful of floppies home to run on our Macintosh at home.\n\nI don't actually remember what model we had at home at the time, it looked like a Power Mac 7100 but did not have a CD-ROM drive–I distinctly remember going to pick up an external CD-ROM drive at CompUSA. My mom got it used, I can't recall where from but it was definitly not a new computer at the time. But I didn't care! I had games, both the 2 or 3 I had on CD-ROM, plus the many I had inadvertantly pirated.\n\nI remember it had an earlier version of System 7 (what I consider to be the quintissential \"Classic Mac OS\") so it was missing some small features that were on the newer university computers. A couple of those features that come to mind are the Control Strip, and the more 3D-esque UI style, both introduced in later version of System 7. I discovered that these features were merely system extensions so I resolved to copy those extensions onto a floppy disk, copy them into the Extensions folder on our Mac at home, and cross my fingers. To my shock and awe, it worked, and that's where my love for tinkering with computers blossomed.\n\nNot too long after, I discovered the application ResEdit, which could have been dangerous, but thankfully I was usually smart enough to make duplicates of anything before modifying them (guess I was born with good data hygene) and lucky enough to not trash any crucial system files.\n\nLater, in middle school and high school, I started making real simple websites, set up a forum (remember those?!), and learned some rudimentary C, tried (and failed) to learn Objective C. In addition, the Unix underpinnings of Mac OS X introduced me to tinkering via the command line.\n\nWould I have followed the same, or similar, path if I'd only ever used Windows PCs? What about if the Macintosh never existed? We'll never know, but I can say for sure that I wouldn't adore computers in quite the same way. Maybe that's a \"fanboi\" thing to say, but I do truly believe it.\n\nOh, and, fun fact; I wrote this entire post in BBEdit 4 inside the Basilisk II emulator running Mac OS 7.6.\n\n[^1]: I actually still have this exact computer, but it's long since bitten the dust.","src/content/blog/2024/ramblings-on-the-macintosh.md","c1cdfc0ecbc9b897",{"html":712,"metadata":713},"\u003Cp>2024 marks the 40th anniversary of the Macintosh.

I remember finding a seemingly limitless repository of software and games-in retrospect, probably pirated-on the university network and taking whatever I could fit on a handful of floppies home to run on our Macintosh at home.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don’t actually remember what model we had at home at the time, it looked like a Power Mac 7100 but did not have a CD-ROM drive–I distinctly remember going to pick up an external CD-ROM drive at CompUSA. My mom got it used, I can’t recall where from but it was definitly not a new computer at the time. But I didn’t care! I had games, both the 2 or 3 I had on CD-ROM, plus the many I had inadvertantly pirated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I remember it had an earlier version of System 7 (what I consider to be the quintissential “Classic Mac OS”) so it was missing some small features that were on the newer university computers. A couple of those features that come to mind are the Control Strip, and the more 3D-esque UI style, both introduced in later version of System 7. I discovered that these features were merely system extensions so I resolved to copy those extensions onto a floppy disk, copy them into the Extensions folder on our Mac at home, and cross my fingers. To my shock and awe, it worked, and that’s where my love for tinkering with computers blossomed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not too long after, I discovered the application ResEdit, which could have been dangerous, but thankfully I was usually smart enough to make duplicates of anything before modifying them (guess I was born with good data hygene) and lucky enough to not trash any crucial system files.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Later, in middle school and high school, I started making real simple websites, set up a forum (remember those?!), and learned some rudimentary C, tried (and failed) to learn Objective C. In addition, the Unix underpinnings of Mac OS X introduced me to tinkering via the command line.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Would I have followed the same, or similar, path if I’d only ever used Windows PCs? What about if the Macintosh never existed? We’ll never know, but I can say for sure that I wouldn’t adore computers in quite the same way. Maybe that’s a “fanboi” thing to say, but I do truly believe it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, and, fun fact; I wrote this entire post in BBEdit 4 inside the Basilisk II emulator running Mac OS 7.6.\u003C/p>\n\u003Csection data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\">\u003Ch2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"footnote-label\">Footnotes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n\u003Cp>I actually still have this exact computer, but it’s long since bitten the dust. \u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003C/section>",{"headings":714,"imagePaths":716,"frontmatter":704},[715],{"depth":318,"slug":319,"text":320},[],"2024/ramblings-on-the-macintosh.md","2024/rip-homepod-mini",{"id":718,"data":720,"body":724,"filePath":725,"digest":726,"rendered":727,"legacyId":733},{"title":721,"pubDate":722,"tags":723},"RIP HomePod Mini",["Date","2024-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"],[82],"Recently, my HomePod Mini broke.

Probably because I never really used Siri regularly on my other devices.[^1] But Siri is the primary way you interact with the HomePod. Sure you can just AirPlay some music to it from your phone, but it's, at least in theory, easier to say \"Hey Siri, play some music\" and have it intelligently play a selection of music that fits your tastes.\n\nWhen it worked, it was amazing. But when it didn't, which slowly became more and more common over time, it was infuriating.

No amount of factory resets would resolve the issue for more than a day, and eventually even AirPlay would just decide to randomly stop working. I know it wasn't my network because during this period I moved to a new apartment and had to get a whole new network setup, and the issue still persisted.\n\nBy the time iOS 17 rolled around and the bulk of the issues seemed to be over though, I had already fell out of the habit of actually using my HomePod. Worst of all though, I lost trust that it would continue to function reliably. It just continued to sit on my shelf, in silence, for months after iOS 17 seemingly fixed my woes.\n\nThen one day I decided to play some music. Not sure what possessed me to try on that particular day, perhaps I was feeling a bit masochistic, but when I spoke the words, \"Hey Siri, play the new Taylor Swift album,\" I was met with silence. I asked again, still nothing. I tried the old \"turn it off and on again\", and the weird little lightshow it usually does didn't happen. I tried another outlet, and got the same result, and I finally accepted that thus cool-but-infuriating little speaker was dead. I hadn't used it in weeks, and I'd moved furniture around to clean several times in that period so I can only assume I damaged the (I'll repeat; _NON-REMOVABLE_) cable while doing that.\n\nMy first thought was, \"Well, surely I can just buy a replacement cable.\" That is when I learned the hard truth.\n\nMy second thought was, \"Well, I'll just buy a new one.\" So I went to Apple.com, added a nice dark blue HomePod Mini to my cart, and decided that I'd wait.\n\nIt's been a week, the HomePod is still in my cart, and I'm not sure I'll ever hit that checkout button. The truth is, I don't miss it. I'd love a little high-quality speaker to play music and podcasts out of, but it's just not worth the frustration for me. I'd pay at least $100 for a speaker that sounds as good as the HomePod Mini, supports AirPlay, and does not have Siri (or any other virtual assistant). That's the route I'd probably go _if_ I can find something like that, though I'm not crossing my fingers.\n\nSo, RIP to my HomePod Mini, the most infuriating Apple product I've ever used.\n\n[^1]: I use Siri occasionally on my iPhone, and not at all on my Mac or iPad.","src/content/blog/2024/rip-homepod-mini.md","d3efe122fb9807ba",{"html":728,"metadata":729},"\u003Cp>Recently, my HomePod Mini broke.
