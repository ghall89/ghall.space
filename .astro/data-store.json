Whether it’s a problem I’m stuck on, or something about the codebase I don’t quite understand, I’m more likely to end up banging my head against the wall trying to find the answers myself than reach out and ask someone a question.\n\nIt’s not out of pride, at least I don’t think it is. It’s more about insecurity. I’m afraid asking for help will somehow reveal to the more experienced devs that I actually have no idea what I’m doing. I will expose myself as a fraud who doesn’t know the first thing about development, and I don’t deserve to get paid for it.\n\nOf course, logically speaking, this is not true. It’s a story told with a combination of imposter syndrome, an anxiety disorder, and a copious amount of logical fallacies. I’m not a fraud, I’m just inexperienced. I can write code, and it may not be the best code ever written but it generally works, and there’s room for me to improve.\n\nAll this to say, it’s ok to ask for help when you need it. I’m writing that as a reminder to myself as much as to you, the reader. No one person has all the answers, and in development there are a multitude of ways to solve a given problem. Consider this: you’re more competent than you give yourself credit for, but maybe you just need a fresh perspective.\n\nI had couple eye-opening experiences this week at work.\n\nFirstly, I was running into an issue where a particular set of values wasn’t getting passed through correctly in our beta environment even though everything was working perfectly when I tested locally on my machine. I was stumped. My boss took a look and suggested I get the values I needed from somewhere else. It worked like a charm! In retrospect, it seemed like the obvious solution, but its easy to get so caught up in looking at a problem in a particular way that you lose sight of other perspectives. In this case, it wasn’t that I didn’t understand what I was doing, I just needed another perspective.\n\nSecondly, earlier in the week I was struggling with trying to track down a particular issue in AWS. I couldn’t find the log I was looking for, and I was completely perplexed. I asked a co-worker, and he asked me if anyone showed me our naming convention for our serverless functions and how to navigate them in AWS. I said no, so he took about 10-15 minutes to show me the ropes. It was something I couldn’t have known, I’d had zero AWS experience before this job and I’m still in the process of getting to grips with our massive codebase. Nobody had taught me what I needed to know, and I had been too nervous to ask, so I just flat out didn’t know.\n\nSo, if there’s one thing I hope we all can take away from this it’s that, if we’re truly stuck on something, there’s more harm in not asking questions. There will always be something you don’t know, and there will always be another way of looking at a problem you’re facing. As long as you’re not asking for help as a first resort, and you’re putting in the effort to try and solve the problem yourself, then just ask the darn question!\n\nAnd if you’re ever feeling any doubt, come back and read this post.

For the last year-and-a-half this has simply been home to my portfolio, but for a while now I’ve wanted to expand from a simple, single-page site to a multi-page site with a blog (which you are of course reading right now).\n\nIn the previous version of this site, I coded myself into a corner. I did a lot of little things I thought were cool, but maybe weren’t the best ideas design-wise, and put things together in such a way that I couldn’t simply tweak things very easily. One of the lessons I took from the experience of building and maintaining that site was to keep things simple, and not try to be too flashy for the sake of being flashy.\n\nAnother lesson I took was to plan ahead for any changes. I didn’t really think about wanting to start a blog until after the site was up, and if I had made things a little easier by planning for future changes it probably wouldn’t have taken a “nuke-and-pave” to cleanly integrate a blog.\n\nI’m also a much better developer than I was when I built version 2. Not saying I’m amazing, I’ve only been at this since late 2020 after all, but I’ve learned a lot about coding, and organizing code in a way that makes sense. Of course, a year from now I’ll be wondering what the heck I was thinking when I originally wrote the code for this site.\n\nAnyway, the first step to any project like this is deciding on the tech stack. As this is a solo project, being my personal site and all, I had a bit of leeway to experiment with different pieces of that puzzle, but I decided on the following:\n\n### Front-end Framework: Next.js\n\nI’m a relative newcomer to Next.js, as I’ve only been using it for about 2 months now. But the learning curve was really low coming from React, and I was able to pick it up pretty quickly when I started my current job.\n\nI prefer it to straight React in a few ways, one of the biggest being how easy it is to set up a multi-page site like this. While it’s definitely possible in React, Next.js makes it painfully simple. It was a no-brainer, and it got me rolling so fast I was able to built this website in a matter of days.\n\n[Check out Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n\nFor styling, I went with good old Tailwind, which I also used on the previous iteration of my site. I’m a very visual person, and Tailwind makes it so easy for me to just built the designs I have in my head.\n\n[Check out Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n\n### Headless CMS: Cosmic\n\nOn the previous iteration of my website, I had built a rudimentary CMS in the command line using M3O for a database, which I then served to the front-end through a small API I built. It was slow and clunky, but it was good enough for periodically updating my portfolio. But, when M3O changed their pricing model, this system became economically infeasible, so I switched to essentially hardcoding my portoflio into my sourcecode, which was something I wanted to avoid. Also, it made the fact I was building my front-end in React a little silly since I had eliminated the one bit of dynamic content on my website. But it was serving its purpose, so I left it.\n\nFor this new iteration, since I wanted to not only go back to managing my portfolio on the back-end, but also build a blog, I knew the best thing to do was to find a pre-packaged solution so I could spend more time focusing on my strengths.\n\n[Check out Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/)\n\n### Final Notes\n\nThere are a couple little Node packages I’ve used to make things a little easier, such as [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), [react-jsx-parser](https://github.com/TroyAlford/react-jsx-parser), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). I particularly had fun with Framer Motion, but I ended up really toning down some of the animations.\n\nAlso, I ended up using the ever-popular VS Code as my text editor instead of my usual go-to, [Nova](https://nova.app/). I started using VS Code again for the first time since early 2021 because of work, and I quickly got spoiled by a lot of the autocomplete features, expecially automatic imports. There will definitly be a breakdown of my thoughts about VS Code vs Nova at some point in the future.\n\n---\n\n_This post was originally published on my (now defunct) blog on my portfolio site [ghall.dev](https://ghall.dev), and was republished here for archival purposes._","src/content/blog/2022/building-ghalldev-30.md","e613db37e72d2ffe",{"html":42,"metadata":43},"\u003Cp>Welcome to my brand new website, the 3rd iteration of ghall.dev!

As you can imagine, it's not an easy topic by any means, as it's something that profoundly affects me personally on a daily basis.\n\nFor a decent chunk of this past week, I've been struggling with a bit of a depressive episode. For me this manifests as lack of motivation, and especially \"brain fog\", which just kills my logical thinking and problem solving skills. Obviously this is not ideal for web development, but I've found ways to make it work and maintain some level of productivity, even if it's not my absolute best.\n\n### Getting Motivated\n\nThe first step to overcoming anything is showing up.\n\nWhether I'm laying in bed wishing I could just go back to sleep, or sitting at my computer struggling to make myself just open my code editor, I have to find a way to get myself motivated. When I'm hitting these low points, I've found it incredibly helpful to break things down into tiny pieces and just work through them a piece at a time.\n\nIf I'm struggling to get out of bed, instead of trying to motivate myself to get up because I need to go to work, I focus on the process one step at a time. It's far easier to motivate myself to do a bunch of little things in sequence than it is to motivate myself to reach the end goal.\n\nThis even applies to just tackling things throughout the day. Today I had a rather large task to complete, and I was simply not motivated to do it. I took it one step at a time, down to the most mundane steps like executing a CLI command, or opening a file. I didn't have to be motivated to finish the task as a whole, I just had to motivate myself to tackle each step until I finished.\n\n### Navigating the Fog\n\nBrain fog is a complicated one. I first experienced the impact it has on coding when I was working on homework for boot camp. It's resulted in me blankly staring at a block of code and just totally forgetting how to read it, or just forgetting the name of a variable I defined less than a minute earlier.\n\nIt's so unbelievably frustrating to experience. The knowledge required to understand the code, the ability needed to problem solve the issue, it's all in there somewhere but it feels like that particular brain function is out of scope.\n\nOne of my bad habits to tackle this problem is coffee. I hate to admit it, but it does help take the edge of the fog.\n\nFirstly, I'd suggest some preventative measures like sleeping, getting some sun when you can, and using a light therapy lamp in the morning on those dark rainy mornings. It seems obvious, but it's worth mentioning these things help manage depression, and, by extension, brain fog.\n\nBut if you're in the moment, the best thing you can do is just step away from the computer for a few minutes. Get up, stretch, walk around, do some jumping jacks, go outside, whatever you can do to just get away from the problem and get your body moving. It's good advice for anyone facing a programming problem, but it's especially good if you're struggling with a bit of brain fog.\n\n### Be Kind to Yourself\n\nThrough all this, the most important thing to remember is to be kind to yourself.\n\nI tend to be extremely self-critical on the best of days, but when I'm struggling and not producing my best work I am even more so. I have to remind myself that this isn't typical, I'm not lazy or dumb, I'm just having a rough time. It's ok to slip up here and there and not be at 100% peak productivity, because I'm doing my best and I'm getting stuff done despite the challenges.\n\n---\n\n_This post was originally published on my (now defunct) blog on my portfolio site [ghall.dev](https://ghall.dev), and was republished here for archival purposes._","src/content/blog/2022/coding-with-depression.md","d2bf7a0999d48ac1",{"html":70,"metadata":71},"\u003Cp>One of the reasons I started this blog, aside from wanting to share my thoughts and experiences as someone early in my web development career, was to write about mental illness as it relates to development.

I’m very introverted and socially anxious, so dating apps seemed like the way to go for me. Sadly, I’ve not had a lot of success, and since Covid it seems like the dating scene has only got worse. I’ve been feeling pretty down about it, but I decided to have a little fun and let an AI help me assemble a brand new profile.\n\nMy goal is to, for an entire week, use my AI generated dating profile. That means my bio and prompts would be written by an AI and all my photos would be selected by an AI. Finally, as long as it doesn’t end in disaster, all my opening messages will be generated by an AI–all further responses will be written by me, because otherwise what would be the point?\n\nI decided to use [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for the written portion, and [Everypixel](https://aesthetics.everypixel.com/) to select the pictures. For the dating app itself, the most important ingredient in this experiment, I decided to go with [Hinge](https://hinge.co/), mainly because I've never used it before.\n\nI decided against using AI generated images because, even though I’m letting an AI create a dating profile for me, I want it to be somewhat genuine. Also I’m not looking to catfish anybody with this image I generated just to see how good AI could make me look:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/my-ai-portrait.jpg\" width=\"260\" alt=\"an AI-generated portrait of me\" />\n\nOriginally this was going to be one post I’d write over the course of a week, but as I was writing I decided I should split it into 2 parts: Part 1, this part, about setting up the dating profile, and part 2, coming at the end of the experiment, about the experience and how it went.\n\nMy first step was to sign up for Hinge. I went through the sign up process, and got to photos. Hinge requires 6 photos to create a profile, so it was Everypixel’s time to shine! I collected up 42 photos from the last few years—I wasn’t aiming for 42 but, as that’s the answer to life, the universe, and everything, I decided to take it as a good omen—and proceeded to feed them through this AI (which I have no doubt added to some collection of images to train machine learning algorithms. Your welcome for the coming robot apocalypse!).\n\nMy first photo didn’t go over very well, with a whopping 0.9% chance of being awesome. Oh well, 41 more pictures to go. After going through the first 5 photos, not a single one scored more than 8%. That’s when I noticed I could get more info about the result, and found this gem: “Surprised by the result? This service doesn't measure the coolness or beauty of a person or any object in a photo.”\n\nSo really all I learned was that my selfies and family photos are garbage. Good to know.\n\nI had to go back to the drawing board. I came across [AttractivenessTest.com](http://AttractivenessTest.com) which admittedly seems more dubious than Everypixel, but sometimes we gotta make sacrifices. Anyways, it seemed to go pretty well, but there was one photo I had to disqualify because the AI kept zeroing in on someone else's face, and 3 that it absolutely refused to process, most likely because it couldn't zero in on my face.\n\nAs I ran through the photos, I sorted them into folders based on the rating they got, from 1 to 10. I don’t mean to brag, but I got a couple 7’s. The problem though was I had 12 6’s, so I couldn’t simply combine these 2 categories so I decided to go back to our old friend Everypixel to pick the top 4 best photos of the ones rated 6. Within a few minutes I had my top 4, ranging from a 1.5% chance to 50% chance to be awesome. Quite a range, and not extremely encouraging but that’s the bed I’ve made for myself.\n\nInteresting note: what I consider the 2 best pictures of me with animals made it through the process and made it to the top 6.\n\nNext up was selecting and answering prompts. While not remotely AI, I decided it best to use a random number generator to help me select which prompts the AI should answer.\n\nThis is where I ran into my first major roadblock. Through the magic of random numbers, for the first prompt I landed on, “Give me travel tips for…” The AI, predictably, gave me some admittedly useful travel tips, but I’m not sure that was in the spirit of the prompt. I decided it best to remove the random factor and hand-select 3 prompts I think the AI might be able to handle.\n\nMy first selection was, “The hallmark of a good relationship is…” Boy did it deliver!\n\n> The hallmark of a good relationship is trust, respect, and open communication. When two people are in a relationship, they should be able to have honest and meaningful conversations, with enough understanding, patience, and empathy to make sure that both perspectives can be heard. A good relationship should also be based on mutual respect, with each person being able to express themselves and their feelings without feeling judged or belittled. Lastly, having a strong foundation of trust and honesty is essential for a healthy and fulfilling relationship.\n\nSadly, it was a little long but with a little bit of trimming I got it to fit into the 220-character limit.\n\nNext up I picked, “The key to my heart is…” To which the AI responded, weirdly in context with the previous prompt, with the following:\n\n> No single \"key\" can unlock a person's heart. The best way forward is to build a relationship based on the qualities mentioned above.\n\nFinally, I picked, “My best dad joke.” The AI did not disappoint.\n\n> Q: What did the sea say to the beach?\n>\n> A: Nothing, it just waved!\n\nWhen I was experimenting with OpenAI initially, I had it prepare a short bio. Unfortunately, it seems that Hinge doesn’t have a field for a bio, but here it is anyway, for posterity.\n\n> I'm an introverted geek who loves all things tech, sci-fi, and fantasy. I enjoy staying inside watching movies, playing video games, and reading comics. I'm looking for someone who shares my interests and is up for some exciting nerd-related activities. I'm a reliable and loyal person who loves to make people laugh. I'm also an animal lover and I like to spend time with cats and dogs. If you think we could be a great match, let's get to know each other better!\n\nSo, how well will this work? Will AI turn my love life around? Or will this backfire spectacularly? Nobody knows!

With nothing to do on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, which was a brisk 15°F, I decided I wanted to search through and try to find a rather lengthy retrospective I wrote on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now that I’ve finally started up a new blog I thought it would be fun to touch it up and republish it, since I put so many hours worth of work into it back in the day.

Admittedly, the chance that you’re in that extremely specific niché is incredibly small. The best data I could find is this [Ars Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/03/7296/) from March 2007 saying the Mac hit about 6% marketshare. And only a tiny subset of those users even had the thought that customizing the look of Mac OS X was something they wanted to do.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/ileopard/mac-os-10-1.png\" width=\"90%\" alt=\"a screenshot of Mac OS X 10.1 with various apps open\" />\n\n*Mac OS X 10.1 and the Aqua Interface, from* [_GUIdebook_](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/macosx101)\n\nI was one of the few that had that had that idea pop into my head. I was super into finding and downloading cool themes, including one I distinctly remember that looked like Windows Vista for some reason. It was 2007, the Aqua Interface (the playful, plastic-looking interface style Apple used for about a decade) was already feeling a little passé to me. I wanted something new, and weirdly enough that new thing came from Apple, in the form of iTunes 7.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/ileopard/itunes-7.gif\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"a screenshot iTunes 7 with the iTunes Music Store open\" />\n\n_iTunes 7 screenshot, from [AppleInsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/06/09/12/apple_introduces_itunes_7_previews_itv_device)_\n\nIn retrospect, and with the hindsight of 15 years of UI design evolution, it’s not exactly pretty, but I liked it at the time. It was classy, and simple, and I thought it was the future of the Mac OS X design language.\n\nFast-forward to the release of Mac OS X Leopard, and I was disappointed to see that the bubbly, lick-able scrollbars and buttons were still quite prominent. Having dabbled in the Mac OS X theming scene already, I decided to take matters into my own hands.\n\nThere was a small problem though. With the release of Leopard, Apple changed the format the system used for UI resources, and introduced a new framework to power it all, called CoreUI. The tools that had existed to make theming the OS relatively simple were useless.\n\nIf you’re curious, [here’s a writeup](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/10/) from John Siracusa’s Mac OS X Leopard review about CoreUI, which was, if I recall, what served as the starting point on the road to being able to even locate the system files I needed to crack open.\n\nNow, just as a heads up, most of what follows is based on memory and a fairly cringy blog post I wrote 10 years ago and found in the bowls of my digital archives. Also, my memory on the timeline is a bit fuzzy, but with some digging I found that this mostly takes place between April and June 2008.\n\nBasically, the main barrier to theming Mac OS X Leopard were 2 files; ArtFile.bin, and SArtFile.bin. This is where nearly all the UI resources were stored, aside from scroll bars, which were stored in a file called Extras.rsrc, a file that had been cracked ages before. If I recall–and I could be totally wrong so if anybody knows better feel free to tell me–Extras.rsrc, and its sister file Extras2.rsrc, still contained all the UI resources, but only the scrollbars were actually used by the system.\n\nI want to make it clear that I can’t take the credit for cracking open ArtFile.bin and SArtFile.bin. I believe it was someone on the MacThemes.net forum, and I wish I could remember or find their name–if you’re out there reading this, thank you! Those files were essentially encrypted ZIP files, and this genius of a human build a command line tool to decrypt and extract them. This was actually the experience that got me comfortable with the command line, and we’ll say indirectly led to my current career as a web developer, but I digress…\n\nAnyway, I knew where to find the files. I had the tool to decrypt the files. The only thing that stood in my way was the mass of nonsensical folder names filled with equally nonsensically named bitmap images that got extracted from the files.\n\nBeing that I was a bored teenager in high school with way too much time on my hands, I decided to figure out exactly what every bitmap image was by methodically changing the graphics to the most garish colors I could, recreating the bin files–which if I recall was as easy as zipping them up and renaming them, but this was 15 years ago so I could definitely be misremembering–restarting my computer, and hunting down the various neon hues while taking notes.\n\nAfter dozens of restarts, and a couple corrupted OS installs, I had figured out a good chunk of the building blocks making up Leopard’s UI. Even still, after weeks of this, there was still so much to be done. Bear in mind, there was no documentation on any of this stuff. I was about to create, as far as I know, the first theme for Mac OS X Leopard.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/ileopard/ileopard-2-0-1.png\" width=\"75%\" alt=\"a screenshot of the Mac OS X Appearance preference pane showing off the modifications made by iLeopard\" />\n\n_iLeopard 2.0.1 screenshot, from [AmazingHenry on MacRumors](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ileopard-theme.2045553/), released by fellow MacThemes.net user ‘gcamp' after I essentially handed off the project_\n\nI started pulling elements from iTunes, and, using a “totally legal, I swear” copy of Adobe PhotoShop, tweaked them to fit in their new home. I shared the very first version of the theme, which I called iLeopard, a portmanteau of iTunes and Leopard, on the MacThemes.net forum (thankfully archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080702015727/http://macthemes2.net:80/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16785679&p=1) by the Wayback Machine!!), and it kind of took off more than I expected. By that, I mean people actually used it. Then it made the MacThemes.net front page. Yeah, it was all a bit overwhelming.\n\nAt some point, I got an offer to help out with the theme from fellow forum user ‘gcamp’. This was probably the best possible thing to happen for the longevity of the theme. He initially started by contributing custom graphics, and ended up taking the reigns on the project after I graduated high school and lost my passion for the project. He kept the project alive, I believe until Apple effectively killed Mac theming for good a few releases later.\n\nThe sad news is I lost all my original work on iLeopard, along with countless other digital relics from that era of my life, when my MacBook suffered a major hard drive crash in 2011. I had to go on a crazy archeological dig through the internet just to find the above screenshot, and it’s from after I handed off the project.

But it stands among Persona 5 and Dragon Quest XI as another modern JRPG that I can not only stomach, but thoroughly enjoy. And to think, I almost skipped out on it because I thought Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was absolute cringe.\n\n### Tunic\n\nI don't play as many indie games as I would like, and I finish even fewer.

Thankfully, Tunic is one I managed to finish.\n\nIt came at just the right time, I had just wrapped up Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and I was in the modo for a light action-adventure game.

Instead, you collect pages of the game's \"manual\" as you play, and have to figure things out from there. Even simple things like how to upgrade your stats isn't explained to you in plain terms.\n\n### Horizon Forbidden West\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn launched in a crowded year for good games, but it stood out to me for its incredibly engrossing story, and its primary mechanic of fighting giant friggin' robots. I was captivated from the start, and was chomping at the bit for a sequel. That sequel finally came, and once again got buried by other games (yeah, I'm looking at you, Elden Ring).

We've seen such an influx of quality titles that it's been hard to even keep track, or even dedicate the time to the ones I have been able to keep track of. One of the two games that has really captured my attention – the other being Tears of the Kingdom – is Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nI’ve typically have had a difficult time getting invested in deep, Western-made RPGs, with the notable exception of The Witcher 3. The specific sub-genre that Baldur’s Gate 3 belongs to, the CRPG (or, Computer Role Playing Game) has been particularly challenging for me to latch on to.\n\nAround late-2020 or early-2021 I started playing Dungeons and Dragons remotely with a couple internet friends. It was in the midst of Covid, so we all had too much time to kill, and would spend a good chunk of our Sundays adventuring across the Forgotten Realms. I’d played D&D before, but it wasn’t something I really got into until that point.\n\nIf I didn’t have this experience I don’t think I would have been open to playing Baldur’s Gate. Because its mechanics are based on the same D&D rules I had spent hours immersed in every Sunday for nearly a year, I was going into the game already knowing the mechanics I usually find overwhelming and obtuse in these types of games.\n\nFor my first playthrough, I decided to port my wood elf ranger, the character I played as in the aforementioned remote D&D campaigns. I tried to recreate him as closely as the game allowed – Baldur’s Gate 3 actually uses a slightly modified version of the current D&D ruleset – and tried to role-play him the same. Basically my head canon was, after his previous adventures, he was thrust into this story.\n\nI never actually finished this playthrough. I got to the final story quest and decided to start over, I’d made so many mistakes, missed out on 3 major companions (Wyll, Karlach, and Halsin), and was only just getting comfortable with the freedom the game offers. Maybe someday I’ll finish my plucky wood elf’s journey, but until then...\n\nFor my second character, I chose to play as the Dark Urge. Unlike a purely custom character like I used for my first playthrough, the Dark Urge is not a blank slate, and has a story that interlinks with the game’s overall story.\n\nFor the Dark Urge I went with a human rogue, and I’ve had a lot more fun leaning into the game’s mechanics this time around. She’s basically a badass assassin, a master of deception, who disguises herself using this magical mask – which I got as part of the deluxe edition – to reach her targets.\n\nThis subtly altered my approach to the game in more ways than I had anticipated. For instance, during the early stages of the game, there's a quest to infiltrate a goblin camp and eliminate their three leaders. On both occasions, I successfully gained entry by persuading the goblins that I belonged to the nefarious cult that plays a significant role in the story. The first attempt required passing a series of deception checks, while during the second attempt, I employed the aforementioned magical mask to transform my character into a Drow – a race of dark elves – allowing me to waltz right into the camp.\n\nCarrying out the quest to take out the 3 goblin leaders played out quite a bit differently, at least on a mechanical level. The first time around I went in guns (er, arrows) blazing to take out the first 2 leaders, and then somehow convincing the 3rd I was on her side, leading her to a Druid grove, and having an all-out battle.\n\nThe second time I took full advantage of my party’s range of capabilities at that point, as well as the environment, to ambush the 3 leaders and get out with as little damage to my team as possible. I had a much easier time using this method, but it was so much more fulfilling to pull off. It didn’t feel cheap because I wasn’t cheesing the mechanics, I was figuring out how to best use them to my advantage.\n\nOn the surface, Baldur’s Gate 3 seems to share very little in common with Tears of the Kingdom, but I think it has enraptured me in much the same way. Both games not only allow you to push their mechanics to the limit to find your own solutions to the challenges they present you, but they make doing so extremely rewarding. These are games that are at their best when you think outside the box and get creative with the tools they give you.\n\nLast year I wrote about [my 3 favorite games of 2022](/posts/2022/my-top-3-games-of-2022) with the intention of doing a similar thing this year, but I don’t think I can. I’ve played a few games that could be the 3rd game in a potential “3 Favorite Games of 2023”, Sea of Stars, Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor come to mind, and while they’re all very good games worthy of the spot, they just didn't come close to impacting me in the same way.\n\nTears of the Kingdom [gave me a place to feel at home](/posts/2023/finding-home-in-hyrule) at a time when I felt out of place after moving apartments. Baldur’s Gate 3 has given me a sense of camaraderie, albeit a virtual one, in a point in my life when I’ve been feeling alone and lost trying to find myself in a new city. No other game I’ve played this year has been a fraction as meaningful as these two have been.","src/content/blog/2023/baldurs-gate-3-feels.md","8e61cb1d5d95716f",{"html":288,"metadata":289},"\u003Cp>2023 has been insane for games.

The first time around I went in guns (er, arrows) blazing to take out the first 2 leaders, and then somehow convincing the 3rd I was on her side, leading her to a Druid grove, and having an all-out battle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The second time I took full advantage of my party’s range of capabilities at that point, as well as the environment, to ambush the 3 leaders and get out with as little damage to my team as possible. I had a much easier time using this method, but it was so much more fulfilling to pull off. It didn’t feel cheap because I wasn’t cheesing the mechanics, I was figuring out how to best use them to my advantage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the surface, Baldur’s Gate 3 seems to share very little in common with Tears of the Kingdom, but I think it has enraptured me in much the same way. Both games not only allow you to push their mechanics to the limit to find your own solutions to the challenges they present you, but they make doing so extremely rewarding. These are games that are at their best when you think outside the box and get creative with the tools they give you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Last year I wrote about \u003Ca href=\"/posts/2022/my-top-3-games-of-2022\">my 3 favorite games of 2022\u003C/a> with the intention of doing a similar thing this year, but I don’t think I can. I’ve played a few games that could be the 3rd game in a potential “3 Favorite Games of 2023”, Sea of Stars, Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor come to mind, and while they’re all very good games worthy of the spot, they just didn’t come close to impacting me in the same way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tears of the Kingdom \u003Ca href=\"/posts/2023/finding-home-in-hyrule\">gave me a place to feel at home\u003C/a> at a time when I felt out of place after moving apartments. Baldur’s Gate 3 has given me a sense of camaraderie, albeit a virtual one, in a point in my life when I’ve been feeling alone and lost trying to find myself in a new city.

I decided to be brave and install the public beta so I could take a look and get some first impressions. As someone with mental health struggles, I appreciate the recent efforts Apple has put into making these kinds of features available, so I was really excited to take a look at this latest addition.\n\nFirst off, I like the simplicity of the interface. It doesn’t have much going on, and I think that’s a point in its favor. You can open the app and get journaling right away. It even offers you journaling prompt which is excellent for those like me who are not always sure what to write about. [^1]\n\nIt doesn’t have the bells and whistles an app like Day One has, but when it comes to writing a journal entry you’re given the option to add photos, location, and even an audio recording. It’s pretty barebones, but I think that’s ok. The one thing I would like is the ability to tie into the mood tracking on Apple Watch and either be able to set your current mood from the app, or tie mood tracking into the Journaling Suggestions feature.\n\nSpeaking of, I actually don’t have much to say about the Journaling Suggestions feature. At the moment it can only suggest journaling based on your workouts, music and podcasts, messages and calls you make, your photos, and significant locations. That’s not at all how I like to journal, so I actually have those turned off. Apparently there’s an API that 3rd party apps can use, but we won’t see what that will bring until iOS 17.2 officially comes out later this year.\n\nSome other things I like are the ability to lock your journal with its own password, which I think is an absolute must for this kind of app, and the ability to set a journal schedule, which is nice for helping to build – or rebuild – a regular journaling habit.\n\nThe one thing I do not like, and this could be the dealbreaker for me, is that, at the moment, Journal is iPhone only. No iPad, no Mac, just iPhone. This severely limits its usability for me, I generally do not like writing anything more than a sentence or 2 on an iPhone. It really needs to be available on all Apple’s platforms and I’m puzzled that it isn’t. Even just making it available on iPad would be acceptable, but as it stands now I don’t think I can make use of it.\n\n[^1]: Shameless plug: I built [a webpage to solve this very problem](https://www.journal-prompt.com).","src/content/blog/2023/journal-app-impressions.md","5e466d3aa46de587",{"html":363,"metadata":364},"\u003Cp>With the upcoming iOS 17.2 update, we’ll finally get our hands on the new Journal app Apple announced at WWDC earlier this year.

At the moment it can only suggest journaling based on your workouts, music and podcasts, messages and calls you make, your photos, and significant locations. That’s not at all how I like to journal, so I actually have those turned off. Apparently there’s an API that 3rd party apps can use, but we won’t see what that will bring until iOS 17.2 officially comes out later this year.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some other things I like are the ability to lock your journal with its own password, which I think is an absolute must for this kind of app, and the ability to set a journal schedule, which is nice for helping to build – or rebuild – a regular journaling habit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The one thing I do not like, and this could be the dealbreaker for me, is that, at the moment, Journal is iPhone only. No iPad, no Mac, just iPhone. This severely limits its usability for me, I generally do not like writing anything more than a sentence or 2 on an iPhone. It really needs to be available on all Apple’s platforms and I’m puzzled that it isn’t. Even just making it available on iPad would be acceptable, but as it stands now I don’t think I can make use of it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Csection data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\">\u003Ch2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"footnote-label\">Footnotes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n\u003Cp>Shameless plug: I built \u003Ca href=\"https://www.journal-prompt.com\">a webpage to solve this very problem\u003C/a>. \u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003C/section>",{"headings":365,"imagePaths":370,"frontmatter":371},[366],{"depth":367,"slug":368,"text":369},2,"footnote-label","Footnotes",[],{"title":356,"pubDate":372,"tags":373},"11/12/23",[94,132,18],"2023/journal-app-impressions.md","2023/my-favorite-little-apps-part-2",{"id":375,"data":377,"body":381,"filePath":382,"digest":383,"rendered":384,"legacyId":404},{"title":378,"pubDate":379,"tags":380},"My Favorite Little Apps, Part 2",["Date","2023-01-21T00:00:00.000Z"],[131,132],"A few months ago, I wrote about [my favorite little Mac apps](/posts/2022/my-favorite-little-apps).

That’s quite a shift, but I felt it was best for the project itself, and my interest in carrying it on.\n\nWithout getting too into the technical details, it required a bit of work to pull off. The app was originally written specifically for the iPhone, and used a bit of custom nonsense that would’t work at all on macOS, so I had to rewrite a non-insignificant part of the user interface. Thankfully I had the forethought to break up my interface code into smaller components, so a lot of that code could be reused (once any iOS-specific code was stripped out). The bulk of the work was rewriting the entire layout to use the screen real estate of the Mac more effectively.\n\nSo, I guess the big question is, “Why did I do this?”\n\nThe answer? Subscriptions.\n\nFrom the get-go I was adamant about making this app a pay once type of deal. I wasn’t looking to make a lot of money, I just wanted to build something that people might want to use. Maybe use it as a way to build towards more lucrative projects if I was lucky. And I didn’t want the to deal with the pressure of subscriptions and the demands that could bring. Maybe this would be something I’d be more comfortable with down the line with an app or 2 under my belt, or if I were doing this full time, but as a little side project I’m just not comfortable with asking people to pay a recurring subscription\n\nBut after running a relatively short TestFlight beta over the summer, and witnessing the drama with the Reddit API, I got very nervous about running an app with the payment structure I wanted off an API I have no control over, and an estimated 30¢ cost per user to run a proxy server on AWS to access that API. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but if for some reason my app happened to blow up (unlikely, but not impossible) I could be stuck with a sizable AWS bill, and no recurring revenue to cover it.\n\nI should probably explain that QuestLogger gets its data from IGDB (Internet Game Database) through an API. In order to access the API, an app first needs to authenticate with their server by sending a pair of authentication keys and receiving back a special “bearer token”. This token can then be used to access the API itself, but as a developer my app can only request a very limited number of tokens at a time across all instances.

That’s quite a shift, but I felt it was best for the project itself, and my interest in carrying it on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Without getting too into the technical details, it required a bit of work to pull off. The app was originally written specifically for the iPhone, and used a bit of custom nonsense that would’t work at all on macOS, so I had to rewrite a non-insignificant part of the user interface. Thankfully I had the forethought to break up my interface code into smaller components, so a lot of that code could be reused (once any iOS-specific code was stripped out). The bulk of the work was rewriting the entire layout to use the screen real estate of the Mac more effectively.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, I guess the big question is, “Why did I do this?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The answer? Subscriptions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From the get-go I was adamant about making this app a pay once type of deal. I wasn’t looking to make a lot of money, I just wanted to build something that people might want to use. Maybe use it as a way to build towards more lucrative projects if I was lucky. And I didn’t want the to deal with the pressure of subscriptions and the demands that could bring. Maybe this would be something I’d be more comfortable with down the line with an app or 2 under my belt, or if I were doing this full time, but as a little side project I’m just not comfortable with asking people to pay a recurring subscription\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But after running a relatively short TestFlight beta over the summer, and witnessing the drama with the Reddit API, I got very nervous about running an app with the payment structure I wanted off an API I have no control over, and an estimated 30¢ cost per user to run a proxy server on AWS to access that API. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but if for some reason my app happened to blow up (unlikely, but not impossible) I could be stuck with a sizable AWS bill, and no recurring revenue to cover it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I should probably explain that QuestLogger gets its data from IGDB (Internet Game Database) through an API.

On the other hand, as a longtime Mac user, I’m a little apprehensive about what we’ll see there.\n\nHardware-wise, the Mac is in a fantastic place. We’re 3 years into the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon, and the design aesthetic is changing up for the first time in like a decade (maybe more??). However, in terms of software, specifically macOS itself, we’re kind of in a weird place.\n\nJust looking at macOS 13 Ventura, the latest version until the next one is most likely announced tomorrow, there are so many little oddities that range from minor annoyances to showstoppers. Some bugs introduced in the betas from last year, for example the infamous launch item notification bug, are _still_ present in the currently shipping version (13.4). Then there’s the mess that is System Settings, which received a major redesign last year for the first time since the Mac OS X betas from 23 years ago.\n\nThen there are some long-standing issues, like a memory leak in the WindowServer system process that has existed since at least Monterey in 2021 (though I feel like I’ve been experiencing it longer). Or the fact that the TV app straight up doesn’t work most of the time.\n\nThen there’s Launchpad (which may not be long for this world as the dedicated key on Apple’s keyboard has been replaced with Spotlight) which I’ve tried to use since it was introduced in Mac OS X Lion all the way back in 2010, but has a bug that will randomly just reorder the icons, which has been an issue since day 1.\n\nOne other long-standing issue that I’ve experienced is how unreliable network drives are. I have a Mac Mini set up as a home server, and the amount of times it’ll just fail to connect when I need to access one of the drives, or Time Machine just fails to recognize that there’s a network volume, is exceedingly frustrating.\n\nThe reliability of macOS varies so much from person to person. Some people experience just one, or maybe even none, of the issues I’ve mentioned. Others experience totally different issues that I’ve never run into. It’s just so wild that an operating system that has been around for 23 years (33 if you count NeXTSTEP as part of the lineage) has so many little issues. Yes, every piece of software has bugs, especially when working with the bogglingly large codebase of an operating system, but so many of what people encounter on the Mac are not small issues.\n\nAll this to say, my one wish for WWDC 2023 is that we _don’t_ see a new version of macOS, and if we do, it’s purely focused on fixing the outstanding issues (and, if we want to get really crazy, fixing the System Settings design). I doubt either of those will happen, but I can certainly dream.","src/content/blog/2023/thoughs-on-macos.md","ab22dd606410397d",{"html":525,"metadata":526},"\u003Cp>So, as of this writing, WWDC 2023 kicks off \u003Cem>tomorrow\u003C/em>.

I decided to try and experiment with combining [MUI Base](https://mui.com/base/getting-started/overview/), the barebones version of the MUI library, with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to allow easier customization. Here's an overview of how I set up a test project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This writeup assumes you have some experience with Next.js, using the terminal, and ideally some experience with MUI and Tailwind.\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Next.js\n\nNothing special is going on here. You can use `npx create-next-app@latest` or `yarn create next-app` depending on which package manager you prefer. I personally like Yarn, so that's what I'll be using. If you use NPM though the commands are similar so you'll be able to follow along.\n\nFollow the prompts to set up your Next.js project. These are the choices I went with:\n\n- Project name: mui-tailwind\n- Typescript: No\n- ESLint: Yes\n- Use 'src/' directory: Yes\n- Experimental 'app/' directory: No\n\nI also chose not to set up any import aliases for now. These can be easily added later if you so choose.\n\nIt will take a few moments for Next.js to download and for the project to set up, but when that's done, cd into '/mui-tailwind' (or whatever you named the project).\n\n## Step 2: Install MUI Base & Tailwind\n\nInstalling MUI Base is simple. Just run `yarn add @mui/base`, and you're good to go. There will be some config to do later, but once the package is done installing we're ready to install Tailwind with `yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`.\n\nOnce both MUI Base and Tailwind are installed, we next need to run `yarn tailwindcss init -p`, which will create 2 files, one called 'tailwind.config.js', and another called 'postcss.config.js'. Now we're ready to do some setup.\n\n## Step 3: Configuration\n\nFirst thing's first, open up the project folder in your code editor of choice and at the root of the project you should see the 'tailwind.config.js' we created in step 2. Open that, and under `module.exports` you should see an empty array named 'content'. Add the following to the array: `'./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'` Your config file should look like this:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/tailwind-config.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"module.exports = { content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [],};\">\n\nNext, we need to import Tailwind into our 'globals.css' file, which is located in 'src/styles/'. We can delete everything in the file as we won't be needing any of it. Then, add the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/global-css.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;\">\n\nAnd that's it! We're ready to start creating something!\n\n## Step 4: Creating Your First Component\n\nIdeally, we'd want to create smaller, reusable component files, but that's beyond the scope of this post, and is something you're most likely already familiar with if you have any experience with Next.js. Instead, we're going to work entirely in 'src/pages/index.js'.\n\nFirst, we should delete everything we don't need so that our 'index.js' file looks like this:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/index-js.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"export default function Home() { return() }\">\n\nWe're going to create a simple button, nothing too fancy. So first we need to import the MUI Unstyled Button component by adding `import { ButtonUnstyled as Button } from '@mui/base'` on the first line of our file.\n\n_Note: The official MUI docs say to import as `import ButtonUnstyled from '@mui/base/ButtonUnstyled'`, which also works, but I prefer to use destructing which allows you to import multiple components with a single import statement'_\n\nNow we can create our button. Inside the return statement, add the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/unstyled-button-code.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"\u003CButton>Click Me!\u003C/Button>\" />\n\nNext, go back to your terminal and run `yarn dev` to start up the dev server, and click the 'localhost' link that appears (most likely 'localhost:3000'). We'll be greeted by what looks like just a bit of text (it's a button, I promise), which isn't what we want, but that's because we haven't added any styles yet!\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/unstyled-button.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"A plain old 'button' that reads 'Click Me!'\" />\n\nAll we need to do is add the `className` prop with some nice Tailwind utility classes:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/styled-button-code.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"\u003CButton className='rounded-lg border-2 border-sky-500 bg-sky-600 py-2 px-10 font-medium text-slate-300 shadow hover:bg-sky-700 active:translate-y-0.5'>\n  Click Me!\n\u003C/Button>\" />\n\nNow, when we go back to the browser, we should see the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/mui-plus-tailwind/styled-button.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"A styled blue button that reads 'Click Me!'\" />\n\nNice! That looks a lot more like a button.\n\n## Step 5: Further Reading\n\nThis tutorial is just the basics of setting up a project using Next.js, MUI Base, and Tailwind. Of course, there's so much more to all these tools than I can possibly cover. For a more in-depth overview, I recommend you check out [this documentation](https://mui.com/base/guides/working-with-tailwind-css/) for using MUI Base with Tailwind, which I used as the basis for this guide, in combination with [this documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) for using Tailwind with Next.js.\n\nOf course, the documentation I linked to at the top of this post is also suggested reading if you're not familiar with any of what I've written about here.","src/content/blog/2023/using-tailwind-with-mui-base.md","85446e6b16a9ad0a",{"html":562,"metadata":563},"\u003Cp>I’ve had some frustration lately working with \u003Ca href=\"https://mui.com\">MUI\u003C/a>, a styled component library for React.

Not on jobs, the economy, or even the damage it’s done to our ability to trust information we see online (whether it’s something generated by a malicious actor looking to mislead, or a simple “hallucination” causing an innocent mistake). No, I’ve been pondering its effects on human creativity, and our capacity to learn and grow as creative creatures. This is something I’ve had in the back of my mind for a quite a while, and I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can put my feelings into words.\n\nMy experience with generative AI started way back at the end of 2022 with [an AI-assisted dating profile](https://ghall.blog/posts/2022/creating-a-dating-profile-with-ai/). Just over a month later, I posted a [follow up](https://ghall.blog/posts/2023/an-update-on-my-ai-dating-profile/), in which I said the following:\n\n> …it didn’t feel like I was presenting my authentic self. Yes, I vetted the text generated by the AI to ensure it wasn’t falsely representing me, but I still felt dirty. Like the few matches I did get weren’t matching with me, but with the AI. My profile may have been technically accurate to who I am as a person, but I felt somewhat removed from it.\n\nI’ve used AI on and off for different reasons since then. I’ve used it to help solve programming issues at work and on side projects, to generate images in various art styles that I don’t have the patience or talent to draw in, and even tinkered with it for writing letters. But I kept experiencing the same feelings I had from “creating” my AI dating profile; these creations were far more a product of the machine than my own humanity.\n\nIt can be–and has been–argued that generative AI democratizes creativity. A person who can barely draw a stick figure can create intricate works of art just by writing some words and feeding them into an algorithm. Or someone with no sense of rhythm or tune can make music that sounds clean and professional. As someone who lacks skill in both those areas (and many more), that sounds incredibly liberating.\n\nBut, the more I think about it, even when ignoring the plagiarism inherent in using generative AI, the more problematic it feels. Yes, generative AI is a tool like any other, and requires a human to operate it[^1], but at what point does a tool eclipse the creative input of the human behind it?\n\nArt, writing, any sort of creative output, is the result of our emotions, our thoughts, our experiences. Perhaps even more important is the journey we must take to create. We can’t be good at everything, and part of the joy of creation is finding the things that we can be good at, and honing that skill.

Not on jobs, the economy, or even the damage it’s done to our ability to trust information we see online (whether it’s something generated by a malicious actor looking to mislead, or a simple “hallucination” causing an innocent mistake). No, I’ve been pondering its effects on human creativity, and our capacity to learn and grow as creative creatures. This is something I’ve had in the back of my mind for a quite a while, and I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can put my feelings into words.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My experience with generative AI started way back at the end of 2022 with \u003Ca href=\"https://ghall.blog/posts/2022/creating-a-dating-profile-with-ai/\">an AI-assisted dating profile\u003C/a>. Just over a month later, I posted a \u003Ca href=\"https://ghall.blog/posts/2023/an-update-on-my-ai-dating-profile/\">follow up\u003C/a>, in which I said the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>…it didn’t feel like I was presenting my authentic self. Yes, I vetted the text generated by the AI to ensure it wasn’t falsely representing me, but I still felt dirty. Like the few matches I did get weren’t matching with me, but with the AI. My profile may have been technically accurate to who I am as a person, but I felt somewhat removed from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>I’ve used AI on and off for different reasons since then. I’ve used it to help solve programming issues at work and on side projects, to generate images in various art styles that I don’t have the patience or talent to draw in, and even tinkered with it for writing letters. But I kept experiencing the same feelings I had from “creating” my AI dating profile; these creations were far more a product of the machine than my own humanity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It can be–and has been–argued that generative AI democratizes creativity. A person who can barely draw a stick figure can create intricate works of art just by writing some words and feeding them into an algorithm. Or someone with no sense of rhythm or tune can make music that sounds clean and professional. As someone who lacks skill in both those areas (and many more), that sounds incredibly liberating.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But, the more I think about it, even when ignoring the plagiarism inherent in using generative AI, the more problematic it feels. Yes, generative AI is a tool like any other, and requires a human to operate it\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>, but at what point does a tool eclipse the creative input of the human behind it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Art, writing, any sort of creative output, is the result of our emotions, our thoughts, our experiences. Perhaps even more important is the journey we must take to create. We can’t be good at everything, and part of the joy of creation is finding the things that we can be good at, and honing that skill. The best painters in history didn’t wake up one day and start making masterpieces, the best writers didn’t start writing classics from the moment they put pen to paper, and the best photographers weren’t masters of framing when they picked up a camera for the first time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would argue that Generative AI does not democratize art or self-expression.

I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love TypeScript",["Date","2024-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"],[113,448],"One of the first steps I took on my post-boot camp webdev journey was to learn TypeScript. It wasn't something that was covered–though I wish it had been, I'll get into why in a second–but it was something we were encouraged to study on our own. I immediately got frustrated, and determined that there was no point. Why would I need to go through the trouble of assigning types to my variables when it was all just getting compiled into vanilla JavaScript anyway?\n\nTwo major things happened since then that changed my tune; I learned Swift, and I started using Bun for personal projects.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle Swift.\n\nLearning Swift was both pretty straightforward coming from JavaScript. The syntax, while pretty different, has some concepts that were familiar to me. By the same token though, Swift is a statically-typed[^1] language and I found that difficult to wrap my head around at first–I had, after all, given up on TypeScript in frustration.\n\nAs I got more comfortable with Swift, I starte to miss the benefits of static typing when working in JavaScript. The ability to just tell my code \"hey, this variable here is an integer\" and have my code crash, or even just fail to even compile, with a super specific error when I inevitably do something stupid and try to treat that variable as a string is infinitely less frustrating than the alternative.\n\nSecondly, there's Bun.\n\nBun is amazing, and I could write an entire post about how much I love working with bun. Heck, maybe I will, but that's something for another day...\n\nThe main thing about Bun that's relevant to my TypeScript journey is the fact that it can natively interpret TypeScript without having to compile to JavaScript. That means that right out of the box, with no dependencies, Bun can just run your TypeScript code just as easily as it can run JavaScript.[^2]\n\nWhile any code getting shipped to the browser will still need to be compiled to vanilla JavaScript, you could, as I understand it, theoretically write your entire back-end in TypeScript and just skip the build step. 🤯\n\nI started off being annoyed with using types in my code because, to be quite frank, they are annoying. They'll make your code throw errors whenever you try to multiply a string, or something silly like that. But that's part of the beauty I've come to appreciate. They're there to help you write better code, and to point you in the right direction when something inevitably goes wrong.\n\n[^1]: [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages) is a StackOverflow thread on the difference between dynamic and static typing put far better than I ever could explain it\n[^2]: As an example, I rewrote [my CLI clone of Wordle](https://github.com/ghall89/wordle-cli) in TypeScript","src/content/blog/2024/doctor-type-love.md","eab4c600e07f3ed1",{"html":652,"metadata":653},"\u003Cp>One of the first steps I took on my post-boot camp webdev journey was to learn TypeScript.

The ability to just tell my code “hey, this variable here is an integer” and have my code crash, or even just fail to even compile, with a super specific error when I inevitably do something stupid and try to treat that variable as a string is infinitely less frustrating than the alternative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Secondly, there’s Bun.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bun is amazing, and I could write an entire post about how much I love working with bun. Heck, maybe I will, but that’s something for another day…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The main thing about Bun that’s relevant to my TypeScript journey is the fact that it can natively interpret TypeScript without having to compile to JavaScript. That means that right out of the box, with no dependencies, Bun can just run your TypeScript code just as easily as it can run JavaScript.\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While any code getting shipped to the browser will still need to be compiled to vanilla JavaScript, you could, as I understand it, theoretically write your entire back-end in TypeScript and just skip the build step. 🤯\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I started off being annoyed with using types in my code because, to be quite frank, they are annoying. They’ll make your code throw errors whenever you try to multiply a string, or something silly like that. But that’s part of the beauty I’ve come to appreciate.

This SSD is also backed up to the 4TB drive (via another install of Carbon Copy Cloner), and is thus included in the Backblaze backup.\n\nI've opted to use Carbon Copy Cloner instead of Time Machine because it offers a lot more flexibility, both in scheduling and in how my backups are organized.\n\nFor example, the external SSD on the Mac Mini doesn't get written to a whole lot, so I have it scheduled to backup once a day. It's probably a little excessive for how often I actually need to save files there, but I figure it's better to backup more often than I actually need.\n\nOn my MacBook, I have it set to backup every 6 hours.

This is more of a convenience than anything else, but because of how I have everything configured it's not possible to boot from my network backup.\n\nAlso, because my backups are over my local network, I can only backup from home. This isn't the end of the world since I don't often take my MacBook with me for more than a few hours but there have been instances where I've been away for a few days with it in tow.

Ever since I discovered Terminal.app in the Utilities folder on my PowerBook G4 back in the day, I've been curious about the kinds of things I could do with it. For most of that time, I've really only used it to change hidden settings, and run tools like 'diskutil', but since entering the world of software development the terminal has become an indispensable tool.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy about the terminal is how customizable it is. If you're on macOS like I am, it can be a nice little reprieve from the relatively locked-down GUI. As such, I've had a lot of fun tweaking the Unix underpinnings of the Mac to my own preferences.\n\n### The Basics\n\nTo start off, let's look at the basic setup. Though macOS comes with the built-in Terminal.app I mentioned earlier, I prefer to use an app called [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com). There are a lot of alternative terminal emulators out there, and I've tried most of them, but I keep coming back to iTerm because it just feels at home on the Mac in the way Warp, Alacritty, and the like, just don't.\n\nFor the shell itself, I use ZSH, which is what ships by default on Mac. I'll admit I'm not sure what the pros and cons are versus something like Bash, but it works for me. I also use [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) for an extra level of customization.\n\nFinally, I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for my package manager. That seems to be the go-to solution for Mac. I use it to not only install and manage the CLI tools I use, but also any GUI apps I install outside the App Store. There's even a nice little app called [Cork](https://github.com/buresdv/Cork) which is a GUI app that makes dealing with Homebrew a lot nicer.\n\n### Themes and Plugins\n\nUsing ohmyzsh opens the door for a lot of easy customization. One of the other tools I use is [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), which can be used with or without ohmyzsh. This allows you to create a theme by mixing and matching several preset options. I went with a pretty barebones, minimal look, but you don't have to go that route.\n\nFor plugins, I use [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete), which is basically a search function and autocompletion for terminal commands. I also use [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), which not only adds a bit of color, but can be useful as well because it will color code valid commands in green and invalid ones in red.\n\n### Useful Tools\n\nThere are also a handful of useful tools I have installed that make using the command line a much more pleasant experience. I'm going to skip over ones like git and Homebrew, they're pretty much a necessity for developers, and instead focus on some tools I'd consider nice to have.\n\nAll of these tools can be installed via Homebrew.\n\n**gum**\n\nThis isn't so much a standalone tool as it is a way to easily add some interactivity to shell scripts. You can easily add text inputs, confirmation dialogs, list selections, and even loading spinners to your shell scripts. There's a lot, so I'd suggest checking out [the readme](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum/blob/main/README.md) to see if it's something you'd find useful.\n\n**mas**\n\nA CLI for the Mac App Store. It may seem a little redundant, but I find it a much more reliable way to update apps installed via the App Store since auto-update seems pretty hit-or-miss, and many times updates will not show for me at all in the GUI interface. Simply running `mas upgrade` will find and install updates much more reliably in my experience.\n\n**thefuck**\n\nEven with all my autocomplete and syntax highlighting shenanigans, I still sometimes make mistakes (ever do a git push without setting an origin?). All I have to do when I make these silly mistakes is run the command `fuck` and it will pretty reliably find and run the command you meant to run.\n\n**yt-dlp**\n\nI don't always have to download YouTube videos, but when I do, I use yt-dlp. It makes it pretty simple to download videos, and it's feels a lot less sketchy than using one of those YouTube downloader websites. Shameless plug, I also [built a GUI front end for it](https://github.com/ghall89/Siphon).\n\n**zoxide**\n\nUsing cd to navigate our computers is an everyday part of using the terminal, but zoxide makes that experience much better. On top just being able to navigate your folders just like with cd, zoxide can keep track of your most visited folders and lets you quickly navigate to them with a fuzzy search. So, say you have a folder you navigate to a lot with `cd ~/Developer/web/personal/my-cool-blog`, instead of having to type that out you can simply type `z web blog` and it will, like magic, take you right there. Also, if you're like me and have the cd command burned into your brain, you can set cd as an alias of z.","src/content/blog/2024/my-terminal-setup.md","8dfb2c1b5e92ae77",{"html":742,"metadata":743},"\u003Cp>The command line is something I’ve tinkered with for years.

For 2023, Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3 blew me away that I couldn’t fathom selecting a third game that stood up to them. This year however, I’m returning to the originally envisioned format for my top 3 games of 2024.\n\nOne of my regrets from the 2022 post was that I didn’t go into very much detail as to why I liked the games, so this time around I wanted to make sure to go more in-depth (but not too in-depth). So, over the course of the year, I’ve kept a journal of every game I finished in 2024, and wrote down what I thought about it while the experience was still fresh in my mind. I chose this list by re-reading my journal and picking the 3 games that, upon reflection, still resonate with me in the same way.\n\n### Star Wars: Outlaws\n\nOk, this is a controversial pick, but, despite its many flaws, Star Wars: Outlaws is a game I genuinely enjoyed from start to finish. Granted, many of its strengths are a result of it being a Star Wars game, but as a fan of the franchise that’s enough for me.\n\nTo me, this game nailed the feeling of being a roguish scoundrel going on adventures across the Star Wars galaxy. From classic locations such as Mos Eisley, to new places like Mirogana, it all felt authentically a part of that galaxy far, far away. It’s clear the people behind the game are big fans of the universe George Lucas created.\n\nEven the typical Ubisoft open-world tropes didn’t detract from the experience. In fact, setting the game across multiple planets, and therefore segmenting the game into smaller open areas instead of one huge map, did a lot to remove the tedium that comes with open-world games.\n\nAnother aspect of the game I enjoyed was the “Reputation System”. During the course of the game you’ll encounter and do missions for various criminal syndicates; The Hutts, The Pykes, Crimson Dawn, and the Ashiga Clan. Which missions you do, and whether you succeed or fail, will affect your standing with these organizations. Raising your reputation with a particular group can unlock special merchants, allow you to take higher paying missions, and freely move about the gangs territory. However, betraying a gang, stealing from them, entering restricted areas, or just being a menace towards them, will lower your reputation. It’s a cool system, and I think it has plenty of room for iteration in a sequel.\n\n### Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\nI have to say, this is the game that most surprised me this year. While I enjoyed Final Fantasy VII Remake–the first entry in this trilogy-to-be of games re-imagining the classic 90’s RPG–when I originally played it during Covid lockdown in 2020, I found it very tedious when I revisited it a couple years ago In addition, 2023’s Final Fantasy XVI left me a bit down on the series as a whole. But I gave Rebirth a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did.\n\nOne thing this game shares in common with the first entry is how well it handles real-time combat, especially compared to the more recent “mainline” entries. Final Fantasy XV’s real-time combat was tedious, while XVI’s was frustrating and shallow. I really appreciate the ability in this game to switch characters in combat to not only keep gameplay interesting, but provide a level of depth and control that the aforementioned mainline games just don’t.\n\nThe world design, similar to Star Wars: Outlaws, is more segmented, which makes the exploration much less tedious, and far more varied. Each map is littered with side objectives to encourage exploration, but it’s not so much that it’s overwhelming. The only 2 exceptions were Cosmo Canyon and Gongaga, which I found extremely convoluted and not at all enjoyable to navigate.\n\nThe game has a multitude of mini-games, which felt like a throwback to an older style of video game design, and I thought it was fun. They weren’t all bangers, but I did find myself engaging in Gwen…sorry, I mean, Queen’s Blood. Also, Chocobo Racing ended up being another big time sink. It was enough to keep me coming back for many more hours, even after I finished the story (and is probably why I didn’t finish more games this year 😬).\n\n### The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom\n\nIt goes without saying, if there’s a new Zelda game out it’s going to make my top 3 games of the year, no question. Like any other game, it’s not perfect. As the first brand-new “2D” Zelda in a decade, and the first in the series to star the titular princess, it had high expectations to live up to, but I think it ran away with them.\n\nIt’s the first Zelda game of this style to take on the open-world design of the 2 most recent 3D games–Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom–and it really fit a lot better that I was expecting. In fact, I’d say it did the open-world much better, because it was reigned in just enough to not impede on the storytelling (such as it is in a Nintendo title), but still gave the player a good level of freedom to explore.\n\nAnother area this game excels is the puzzles. Much like in Tears of the Kingdom, the puzzles in this game are more focused on player creativity and finding fun solutions than simply trying to figure out the one solution the designers intended. Much of this creativity comes from what this game calls “echoes”, basically various objects and enemies you can conjure up.\n\nI hope this is a concept Nintendo revisits, because I really want to see a successor to this game that iterates upon what is already great, and improves on what didn’t quite work.

No amount of factory resets would resolve the issue for more than a day, and eventually even AirPlay would just decide to randomly stop working. I know it wasn't my network because during this period I moved to a new apartment and had to get a whole new network setup, and the issue still persisted.\n\nBy the time iOS 17 rolled around and the bulk of the issues seemed to be over though, I had already fell out of the habit of actually using my HomePod.

I looked around for an app that would do this, and couldn't find one that worked reliably.\n\nSo, like any nerd with a bit too much free time, I thought I could make one myself. The problem is, I didn't know where to start, so I ended up putting the project off for months. Finally, last night I got a bit inspired to at least learn how to detect and read the displays connected to a Mac, which involved diving into the CoreGraphics API, something I was pretty unfamiliar with.\n\nOne thing led to another, and before I knew it I went from my original idea to working MVP in just a couple hours, which was not at all my plan. This morning, I had a few ideas to improve the UX which I then implemented and decided it was good enough to throw the 1.0 up online.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's probably the first Mac app that I've made that I can say I'm truly proud of.

This is going to be a bit of a challenge, but here we go...\n\n## What Are 5 Of Your Favorite Albums?\n\nThere are so many albums I'd consider favorites, narrowing them down to just 5 seems like an impossible task. Here's the 5 I've whittled my list down to, with the disclaimer that I don't necessarily like them more than other albums that didn't make the cut.\n\n- The Else - They Might Be Giants\n- Ocean Eyes - Owl City\n- Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand\n- Hey, I'm Just Like You - Tegan and Sara\n- White Blood Cells - The White Stripes\n\n## What Are 5 Of Your Favorite Songs?\n\nDitto for songs, but 100x more difficult...\n\n- Synopsis for Latecomers - They Might Be Giants\n- What Feels Like Eternity - Metric\n- The Last Great American Dynasty - Taylor Swift\n- This is Why - Paramore\n- Good Morning Tucson - Jonathan Coulton\n\n## Favorite Instrument(s)?\n\nI used to play the trumpet, so that's probably my favorite. After that, probably keyboard because I think it would be fun to play.\n\n## What Song Or Album Are You Currently Listening To?\n\nAs I write this, I am listening to Poké & Chill, which is an album of lo-fi renditions of music from the Pokémon video games.\n\n## Do You Listen To The Radio, And If So, How Often?\n\nI don't listen to the radio at all anymore. The one station I did listen to closed and got sold off years ago, and so my days of listening to the radio ended.\n\n## How Often Do You Listen To Music?\n\nAlmost constantly. I sometimes substitute it out for podcasts, but I'm generally listening to music while I work, clean, or just relax. I also listen to music while I write, but I generally only listen to various lo-fi albums.\n\n## How Often Do You Discover Music And How Do You Discover It?\n\nI don't discover as much new music as I would like to, but when I do it's through Apple Music in the New section, or from listening to some of their recommended playlists.\n\n## What’s A Song Or Album You Enjoy That You Wish Had More Recognition?\n\nI'm absolutely 100% biased here since I know the artist, but my pick is [Here's to the Sojourners](https://album.link/i/1598277466) by Nathan Landis Funk. Cool music by a cool guy.\n\n## What’s Your Favorite Song Of All Time?\n\nThis answer changes constantly, but at the moment I'd have to pick Birdhouse in Your Soul by They Might Be Giants. It's perhaps an odd choice, but it never fails to cheer me up when I'm feeling down and that's enough to cement it as my favorite...for the moment.\n\n## Has Your Taste Of Music Evolved Over The Years?\n\nI'd say it's expanded quite a bit, and I'd even say changed slighlty. I had a very limited taste in high school, and, while I still do like a lot of the music I listened to then, as my tastes have expanded I've found myself perferring a lot of different artists and genres. \"Alternative\" is still the most common genre in my Apple Music library, but over the last 16 years I've added electronic, folk, grunge, K-pop, and \"singer/songwriter\" (though I'm still not entirely sure what that means as a genre 🤷‍♂️).\n\nSo, after much overthinking, those are my answers to these musical questions.
