It’s a story told with a combination of imposter syndrome, an anxiety disorder, and a copious amount of logical fallacies. I’m not a fraud, I’m just inexperienced.

I’m writing that as a reminder to myself as much as to you, the reader. No one person has all the answers, and in development there are a multitude of ways to solve a given problem. Consider this: you’re more competent than you give yourself credit for, but maybe you just need a fresh perspective.\n\nI had couple eye-opening experiences this week at work.\n\nFirstly, I was running into an issue where a particular set of values wasn’t getting passed through correctly in our beta environment even though everything was working perfectly when I tested locally on my machine. I was stumped. My boss took a look and suggested I get the values I needed from somewhere else. It worked like a charm! In retrospect, it seemed like the obvious solution, but its easy to get so caught up in looking at a problem in a particular way that you lose sight of other perspectives. In this case, it wasn’t that I didn’t understand what I was doing, I just needed another perspective.\n\nSecondly, earlier in the week I was struggling with trying to track down a particular issue in AWS. I couldn’t find the log I was looking for, and I was completely perplexed. I asked a co-worker, and he asked me if anyone showed me our naming convention for our serverless functions and how to navigate them in AWS. I said no, so he took about 10-15 minutes to show me the ropes.

There will always be something you don’t know, and there will always be another way of looking at a problem you’re facing.

I’m very introverted and socially anxious, so dating apps seemed like the way to go for me. Sadly, I’ve not had a lot of success, and since Covid it seems like the dating scene has only got worse. I’ve been feeling pretty down about it, but I decided to have a little fun and let an AI help me assemble a brand new profile.\n\nMy goal is to, for an entire week, use my AI generated dating profile. That means my bio and prompts would be written by an AI and all my photos would be selected by an AI. Finally, as long as it doesn’t end in disaster, all my opening messages will be generated by an AI–all further responses will be written by me, because otherwise what would be the point?\n\nI decided to use [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for the written portion, and [Everypixel](https://aesthetics.everypixel.com/) to select the pictures. For the dating app itself, the most important ingredient in this experiment, I decided to go with [Hinge](https://hinge.co/), mainly because I've never used it before.\n\nI decided against using AI generated images because, even though I’m letting an AI create a dating profile for me, I want it to be somewhat genuine. Also I’m not looking to catfish anybody with this image I generated just to see how good AI could make me look:\n\n![An AI-generated portrait of me](src/assets/blog/my-ai-portrait.jpg)\n\nOriginally this was going to be one post I’d write over the course of a week, but as I was writing I decided I should split it into 2 parts: Part 1, this part, about setting up the dating profile, and part 2, coming at the end of the experiment, about the experience and how it went.\n\nMy first step was to sign up for Hinge. I went through the sign up process, and got to photos. Hinge requires 6 photos to create a profile, so it was Everypixel’s time to shine! I collected up 42 photos from the last few years—I wasn’t aiming for 42 but, as that’s the answer to life, the universe, and everything, I decided to take it as a good omen—and proceeded to feed them through this AI (which I have no doubt added to some collection of images to train machine learning algorithms. Your welcome for the coming robot apocalypse!).\n\nMy first photo didn’t go over very well, with a whopping 0.9% chance of being awesome. Oh well, 41 more pictures to go. After going through the first 5 photos, not a single one scored more than 8%. That’s when I noticed I could get more info about the result, and found this gem: “Surprised by the result? This service doesn't measure the coolness or beauty of a person or any object in a photo.”\n\nSo really all I learned was that my selfies and family photos are garbage. Good to know.\n\nI had to go back to the drawing board. I came across [AttractivenessTest.com](http://AttractivenessTest.com) which admittedly seems more dubious than Everypixel, but sometimes we gotta make sacrifices. Anyways, it seemed to go pretty well, but there was one photo I had to disqualify because the AI kept zeroing in on someone else's face, and 3 that it absolutely refused to process, most likely because it couldn't zero in on my face.\n\nAs I ran through the photos, I sorted them into folders based on the rating they got, from 1 to 10. I don’t mean to brag, but I got a couple 7’s. The problem though was I had 12 6’s, so I couldn’t simply combine these 2 categories so I decided to go back to our old friend Everypixel to pick the top 4 best photos of the ones rated 6. Within a few minutes I had my top 4, ranging from a 1.5% chance to 50% chance to be awesome. Quite a range, and not extremely encouraging but that’s the bed I’ve made for myself.\n\nInteresting note: what I consider the 2 best pictures of me with animals made it through the process and made it to the top 6.\n\nNext up was selecting and answering prompts. While not remotely AI, I decided it best to use a random number generator to help me select which prompts the AI should answer.\n\nThis is where I ran into my first major roadblock. Through the magic of random numbers, for the first prompt I landed on, “Give me travel tips for…” The AI, predictably, gave me some admittedly useful travel tips, but I’m not sure that was in the spirit of the prompt. I decided it best to remove the random factor and hand-select 3 prompts I think the AI might be able to handle.\n\nMy first selection was, “The hallmark of a good relationship is…” Boy did it deliver!\n\n> The hallmark of a good relationship is trust, respect, and open communication. When two people are in a relationship, they should be able to have honest and meaningful conversations, with enough understanding, patience, and empathy to make sure that both perspectives can be heard. A good relationship should also be based on mutual respect, with each person being able to express themselves and their feelings without feeling judged or belittled. Lastly, having a strong foundation of trust and honesty is essential for a healthy and fulfilling relationship.\n\nSadly, it was a little long but with a little bit of trimming I got it to fit into the 220-character limit.\n\nNext up I picked, “The key to my heart is…” To which the AI responded, weirdly in context with the previous prompt, with the following:\n\n> No single \"key\" can unlock a person's heart. The best way forward is to build a relationship based on the qualities mentioned above.\n\nFinally, I picked, “My best dad joke.” The AI did not disappoint.\n\n> Q: What did the sea say to the beach?\n>\n> A: Nothing, it just waved!\n\nWhen I was experimenting with OpenAI initially, I had it prepare a short bio. Unfortunately, it seems that Hinge doesn’t have a field for a bio, but here it is anyway, for posterity.\n\n> I'm an introverted geek who loves all things tech, sci-fi, and fantasy. I enjoy staying inside watching movies, playing video games, and reading comics. I'm looking for someone who shares my interests and is up for some exciting nerd-related activities. I'm a reliable and loyal person who loves to make people laugh. I'm also an animal lover and I like to spend time with cats and dogs. If you think we could be a great match, let's get to know each other better!\n\nSo, how well will this work? Will AI turn my love life around? Or will this backfire spectacularly? Nobody knows!

For the last year-and-a-half this has simply been home to my portfolio, but for a while now I’ve wanted to expand from a simple, single-page site to a multi-page site with a blog (which you are of course reading right now).\n\nIn the previous version of this site, I coded myself into a corner. I did a lot of little things I thought were cool, but maybe weren’t the best ideas design-wise, and put things together in such a way that I couldn’t simply tweak things very easily. One of the lessons I took from the experience of building and maintaining that site was to keep things simple, and not try to be too flashy for the sake of being flashy.\n\nAnother lesson I took was to plan ahead for any changes. I didn’t really think about wanting to start a blog until after the site was up, and if I had made things a little easier by planning for future changes it probably wouldn’t have taken a “nuke-and-pave” to cleanly integrate a blog.\n\nI’m also a much better developer than I was when I built version 2. Not saying I’m amazing, I’ve only been at this since late 2020 after all, but I’ve learned a lot about coding, and organizing code in a way that makes sense. Of course, a year from now I’ll be wondering what the heck I was thinking when I originally wrote the code for this site.\n\nAnyway, the first step to any project like this is deciding on the tech stack. As this is a solo project, being my personal site and all, I had a bit of leeway to experiment with different pieces of that puzzle, but I decided on the following:\n\n### Front-end Framework: Next.js\n\nI’m a relative newcomer to Next.js, as I’ve only been using it for about 2 months now. But the learning curve was really low coming from React, and I was able to pick it up pretty quickly when I started my current job.\n\nI prefer it to straight React in a few ways, one of the biggest being how easy it is to set up a multi-page site like this. While it’s definitely possible in React, Next.js makes it painfully simple. It was a no-brainer, and it got me rolling so fast I was able to built this website in a matter of days.\n\n[Check out Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n\nFor styling, I went with good old Tailwind, which I also used on the previous iteration of my site. I’m a very visual person, and Tailwind makes it so easy for me to just built the designs I have in my head.\n\n[Check out Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n\n### Headless CMS: Cosmic\n\nOn the previous iteration of my website, I had built a rudimentary CMS in the command line using M3O for a database, which I then served to the front-end through a small API I built. It was slow and clunky, but it was good enough for periodically updating my portfolio.

For the last year-and-a-half this has simply been home to my portfolio, but for a while now I’ve wanted to expand from a simple, single-page site to a multi-page site with a blog (which you are of course reading right now).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the previous version of this site, I coded myself into a corner. I did a lot of little things I thought were cool, but maybe weren’t the best ideas design-wise, and put things together in such a way that I couldn’t simply tweak things very easily. One of the lessons I took from the experience of building and maintaining that site was to keep things simple, and not try to be too flashy for the sake of being flashy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another lesson I took was to plan ahead for any changes. I didn’t really think about wanting to start a blog until after the site was up, and if I had made things a little easier by planning for future changes it probably wouldn’t have taken a “nuke-and-pave” to cleanly integrate a blog.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’m also a much better developer than I was when I built version 2. Not saying I’m amazing, I’ve only been at this since late 2020 after all, but I’ve learned a lot about coding, and organizing code in a way that makes sense. Of course, a year from now I’ll be wondering what the heck I was thinking when I originally wrote the code for this site.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Anyway, the first step to any project like this is deciding on the tech stack. As this is a solo project, being my personal site and all, I had a bit of leeway to experiment with different pieces of that puzzle, but I decided on the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"front-end-framework-nextjs\">Front-end Framework: Next.js\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>I’m a relative newcomer to Next.js, as I’ve only been using it for about 2 months now. But the learning curve was really low coming from React, and I was able to pick it up pretty quickly when I started my current job.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I prefer it to straight React in a few ways, one of the biggest being how easy it is to set up a multi-page site like this. While it’s definitely possible in React, Next.js makes it painfully simple. It was a no-brainer, and it got me rolling so fast I was able to built this website in a matter of days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Check out Next.js\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For styling, I went with good old Tailwind, which I also used on the previous iteration of my site. I’m a very visual person, and Tailwind makes it so easy for me to just built the designs I have in my head.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Check out Tailwind\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"headless-cms-cosmic\">Headless CMS: Cosmic\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>On the previous iteration of my website, I had built a rudimentary CMS in the command line using M3O for a database, which I then served to the front-end through a small API I built. It was slow and clunky, but it was good enough for periodically updating my portfolio. But, when M3O changed their pricing model, this system became economically infeasible, so I switched to essentially hardcoding my portoflio into my sourcecode, which was something I wanted to avoid. Also, it made the fact I was building my front-end in React a little silly since I had eliminated the one bit of dynamic content on my website.

With nothing to do on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, which was a brisk 15°F, I decided I wanted to search through and try to find a rather lengthy retrospective I wrote on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now that I’ve finally started up a new blog I thought it would be fun to touch it up and republish it, since I put so many hours worth of work into it back in the day. Upsettingly, it was not there.\n\nBut I did find a rather salty post I wrote about a Mac theme I created back when I was a senior in high school. I thought it would be nice to go back and take a fresh look at the project, and how I feel about it now, being another 10 years removed from it.\n\nIf you were around the Mac customization scene–specifically on the now-defunct MacThemes.net–around 2007, you probably remember a little project called iLeopard. Admittedly, the chance that you’re in that extremely specific niché is incredibly small. The best data I could find is this [Ars Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/03/7296/) from March 2007 saying the Mac hit about 6% marketshare. And only a tiny subset of those users even had the thought that customizing the look of Mac OS X was something they wanted to do.\n\n![a screenshot of Mac OS X 10.1 with various apps open](src/assets/blog/ileopard/mac-os-10-1.png)\n\n*Mac OS X 10.1 and the Aqua Interface, from* [_GUIdebook_](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/macosx101)\n\nI was one of the few that had that had that idea pop into my head. I was super into finding and downloading cool themes, including one I distinctly remember that looked like Windows Vista for some reason. It was 2007, the Aqua Interface (the playful, plastic-looking interface style Apple used for about a decade) was already feeling a little passé to me. I wanted something new, and weirdly enough that new thing came from Apple, in the form of iTunes 7.\n\n![a screenshot iTunes 7 with the iTunes Music Store open](src/assets/blog/ileopard/itunes-7.gif)\n\n_iTunes 7 screenshot, from [AppleInsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/06/09/12/apple_introduces_itunes_7_previews_itv_device)_\n\nIn retrospect, and with the hindsight of 15 years of UI design evolution, it’s not exactly pretty, but I liked it at the time. It was classy, and simple, and I thought it was the future of the Mac OS X design language.\n\nFast-forward to the release of Mac OS X Leopard, and I was disappointed to see that the bubbly, lick-able scrollbars and buttons were still quite prominent. Having dabbled in the Mac OS X theming scene already, I decided to take matters into my own hands.\n\nThere was a small problem though. With the release of Leopard, Apple changed the format the system used for UI resources, and introduced a new framework to power it all, called CoreUI. The tools that had existed to make theming the OS relatively simple were useless.\n\nIf you’re curious, [here’s a writeup](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/10/) from John Siracusa’s Mac OS X Leopard review about CoreUI, which was, if I recall, what served as the starting point on the road to being able to even locate the system files I needed to crack open.\n\nNow, just as a heads up, most of what follows is based on memory and a fairly cringy blog post I wrote 10 years ago and found in the bowls of my digital archives. Also, my memory on the timeline is a bit fuzzy, but with some digging I found that this mostly takes place between April and June 2008.\n\nBasically, the main barrier to theming Mac OS X Leopard were 2 files; ArtFile.bin, and SArtFile.bin. This is where nearly all the UI resources were stored, aside from scroll bars, which were stored in a file called Extras.rsrc, a file that had been cracked ages before. If I recall–and I could be totally wrong so if anybody knows better feel free to tell me–Extras.rsrc, and its sister file Extras2.rsrc, still contained all the UI resources, but only the scrollbars were actually used by the system.\n\nI want to make it clear that I can’t take the credit for cracking open ArtFile.bin and SArtFile.bin. I believe it was someone on the MacThemes.net forum, and I wish I could remember or find their name–if you’re out there reading this, thank you! Those files were essentially encrypted ZIP files, and this genius of a human build a command line tool to decrypt and extract them. This was actually the experience that got me comfortable with the command line, and we’ll say indirectly led to my current career as a web developer, but I digress…\n\nAnyway, I knew where to find the files. I had the tool to decrypt the files. The only thing that stood in my way was the mass of nonsensical folder names filled with equally nonsensically named bitmap images that got extracted from the files.\n\nBeing that I was a bored teenager in high school with way too much time on my hands, I decided to figure out exactly what every bitmap image was by methodically changing the graphics to the most garish colors I could, recreating the bin files–which if I recall was as easy as zipping them up and renaming them, but this was 15 years ago so I could definitely be misremembering–restarting my computer, and hunting down the various neon hues while taking notes.\n\nAfter dozens of restarts, and a couple corrupted OS installs, I had figured out a good chunk of the building blocks making up Leopard’s UI. Even still, after weeks of this, there was still so much to be done. Bear in mind, there was no documentation on any of this stuff. I was about to create, as far as I know, the first theme for Mac OS X Leopard.\n\n![a screenshot of the Mac OS X Appearance preference pane showing off the modifications made by iLeopard](src/assets/blog/ileopard/ileopard-2-0-1.png)\n\n_iLeopard 2.0.1 screenshot, from [AmazingHenry on MacRumors](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ileopard-theme.2045553/), released by fellow MacThemes.net user ‘gcamp' after I essentially handed off the project_\n\nI started pulling elements from iTunes, and, using a “totally legal, I swear” copy of Adobe PhotoShop, tweaked them to fit in their new home. I shared the very first version of the theme, which I called iLeopard, a portmanteau of iTunes and Leopard, on the MacThemes.net forum (thankfully archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080702015727/http://macthemes2.net:80/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16785679&p=1) by the Wayback Machine!!), and it kind of took off more than I expected. By that, I mean people actually used it. Then it made the MacThemes.net front page. Yeah, it was all a bit overwhelming.\n\nAt some point, I got an offer to help out with the theme from fellow forum user ‘gcamp’. This was probably the best possible thing to happen for the longevity of the theme. He initially started by contributing custom graphics, and ended up taking the reigns on the project after I graduated high school and lost my passion for the project. He kept the project alive, I believe until Apple effectively killed Mac theming for good a few releases later.\n\nThe sad news is I lost all my original work on iLeopard, along with countless other digital relics from that era of my life, when my MacBook suffered a major hard drive crash in 2011.

It ended up being pretty much the only game I played for weeks.\n\nIt scratches several RPG itches for me; a compelling cast of characters, a fun combat system that you can spend hours just experimenting with, and an intriguing world I still long to go back to even months later. This is definitely a game I will keep coming back to, between all the side content I still have left, and the DLC that's slowly rolling out.\n\nIs it a masterpiece? Probably not. But it stands among Persona 5 and Dragon Quest XI as another modern JRPG that I can not only stomach, but thoroughly enjoy. And to think, I almost skipped out on it because I thought Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was absolute cringe.\n\n### Tunic\n\nI don't play as many indie games as I would like, and I finish even fewer. I love indie games, perhaps a little too much, because I'm always jumping around to the latest one that's grabbed my attention. Thankfully, Tunic is one I managed to finish.\n\nIt came at just the right time, I had just wrapped up Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and I was in the modo for a light action-adventure game.

Instead, you collect pages of the game's \"manual\" as you play, and have to figure things out from there. Even simple things like how to upgrade your stats isn't explained to you in plain terms.\n\n### Horizon Forbidden West\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn launched in a crowded year for good games, but it stood out to me for its incredibly engrossing story, and its primary mechanic of fighting giant friggin' robots. I was captivated from the start, and was chomping at the bit for a sequel. That sequel finally came, and once again got buried by other games (yeah, I'm looking at you, Elden Ring). But I didn't care, I wanted to see the next chapter in Aloy's story.\n\nI will confess, the story didn't grab me as much as the first game's. It was a satisfying continuation for me, without a doubt, but part of the mystery that made the first game so compelling–namely; how the world ended up in the state it is in the game–was already solved.\n\nThe gameplay in this sequel, however, was a _huge_ improvement. Melee combat, world traversal, side content, it was all so much better in this game, and showed that the developers took the feedback of the first game to heart.

As you can imagine, it's not an easy topic by any means, as it's something that profoundly affects me personally on a daily basis.\n\nFor a decent chunk of this past week, I've been struggling with a bit of a depressive episode. For me this manifests as lack of motivation, and especially \"brain fog\", which just kills my logical thinking and problem solving skills. Obviously this is not ideal for web development, but I've found ways to make it work and maintain some level of productivity, even if it's not my absolute best.\n\n### Getting Motivated\n\nThe first step to overcoming anything is showing up.\n\nWhether I'm laying in bed wishing I could just go back to sleep, or sitting at my computer struggling to make myself just open my code editor, I have to find a way to get myself motivated. When I'm hitting these low points, I've found it incredibly helpful to break things down into tiny pieces and just work through them a piece at a time.\n\nIf I'm struggling to get out of bed, instead of trying to motivate myself to get up because I need to go to work, I focus on the process one step at a time. It's far easier to motivate myself to do a bunch of little things in sequence than it is to motivate myself to reach the end goal.\n\nThis even applies to just tackling things throughout the day. Today I had a rather large task to complete, and I was simply not motivated to do it. I took it one step at a time, down to the most mundane steps like executing a CLI command, or opening a file. I didn't have to be motivated to finish the task as a whole, I just had to motivate myself to tackle each step until I finished.\n\n### Navigating the Fog\n\nBrain fog is a complicated one. I first experienced the impact it has on coding when I was working on homework for boot camp. It's resulted in me blankly staring at a block of code and just totally forgetting how to read it, or just forgetting the name of a variable I defined less than a minute earlier.\n\nIt's so unbelievably frustrating to experience. The knowledge required to understand the code, the ability needed to problem solve the issue, it's all in there somewhere but it feels like that particular brain function is out of scope.\n\nOne of my bad habits to tackle this problem is coffee. I hate to admit it, but it does help take the edge of the fog.\n\nFirstly, I'd suggest some preventative measures like sleeping, getting some sun when you can, and using a light therapy lamp in the morning on those dark rainy mornings. It seems obvious, but it's worth mentioning these things help manage depression, and, by extension, brain fog.\n\nBut if you're in the moment, the best thing you can do is just step away from the computer for a few minutes. Get up, stretch, walk around, do some jumping jacks, go outside, whatever you can do to just get away from the problem and get your body moving. It's good advice for anyone facing a programming problem, but it's especially good if you're struggling with a bit of brain fog.\n\n### Be Kind to Yourself\n\nThrough all this, the most important thing to remember is to be kind to yourself.\n\nI tend to be extremely self-critical on the best of days, but when I'm struggling and not producing my best work I am even more so. I have to remind myself that this isn't typical, I'm not lazy or dumb, I'm just having a rough time. It's ok to slip up here and there and not be at 100% peak productivity, because I'm doing my best and I'm getting stuff done despite the challenges.\n\n---\n\n_This post was originally published on my (now defunct) blog on my portfolio site [ghall.dev](https://ghall.dev), and was republished here for archival purposes._","src/content/blog/2022/coding-with-depression.md","d2bf7a0999d48ac1",{"html":222,"metadata":223},"\u003Cp>One of the reasons I started this blog, aside from wanting to share my thoughts and experiences as someone early in my web development career, was to write about mental illness as it relates to development.

Obviously this is not ideal for web development, but I’ve found ways to make it work and maintain some level of productivity, even if it’s not my absolute best.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"getting-motivated\">Getting Motivated\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The first step to overcoming anything is showing up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Whether I’m laying in bed wishing I could just go back to sleep, or sitting at my computer struggling to make myself just open my code editor, I have to find a way to get myself motivated. When I’m hitting these low points, I’ve found it incredibly helpful to break things down into tiny pieces and just work through them a piece at a time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I’m struggling to get out of bed, instead of trying to motivate myself to get up because I need to go to work, I focus on the process one step at a time. It’s far easier to motivate myself to do a bunch of little things in sequence than it is to motivate myself to reach the end goal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This even applies to just tackling things throughout the day. Today I had a rather large task to complete, and I was simply not motivated to do it. I took it one step at a time, down to the most mundane steps like executing a CLI command, or opening a file. I didn’t have to be motivated to finish the task as a whole, I just had to motivate myself to tackle each step until I finished.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"navigating-the-fog\">Navigating the Fog\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Brain fog is a complicated one. I first experienced the impact it has on coding when I was working on homework for boot camp. It’s resulted in me blankly staring at a block of code and just totally forgetting how to read it, or just forgetting the name of a variable I defined less than a minute earlier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s so unbelievably frustrating to experience. The knowledge required to understand the code, the ability needed to problem solve the issue, it’s all in there somewhere but it feels like that particular brain function is out of scope.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of my bad habits to tackle this problem is coffee. I hate to admit it, but it does help take the edge of the fog.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Firstly, I’d suggest some preventative measures like sleeping, getting some sun when you can, and using a light therapy lamp in the morning on those dark rainy mornings. It seems obvious, but it’s worth mentioning these things help manage depression, and, by extension, brain fog.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But if you’re in the moment, the best thing you can do is just step away from the computer for a few minutes. Get up, stretch, walk around, do some jumping jacks, go outside, whatever you can do to just get away from the problem and get your body moving. It’s good advice for anyone facing a programming problem, but it’s especially good if you’re struggling with a bit of brain fog.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"be-kind-to-yourself\">Be Kind to Yourself\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Through all this, the most important thing to remember is to be kind to yourself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I tend to be extremely self-critical on the best of days, but when I’m struggling and not producing my best work I am even more so. I have to remind myself that this isn’t typical, I’m not lazy or dumb, I’m just having a rough time. It’s ok to slip up here and there and not be at 100% peak productivity, because I’m doing my best and I’m getting stuff done despite the challenges.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>This post was originally published on my (now defunct) blog on my portfolio site \u003Ca href=\"https://ghall.dev\">ghall.dev\u003C/a>, and was republished here for archival purposes.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>",{"headings":224,"localImagePaths":234,"remoteImagePaths":235,"frontmatter":236,"imagePaths":239},[225,228,231],{"depth":70,"slug":226,"text":227},"getting-motivated","Getting Motivated",{"depth":70,"slug":229,"text":230},"navigating-the-fog","Navigating the Fog",{"depth":70,"slug":232,"text":233},"be-kind-to-yourself","Be Kind to Yourself",[],[],{"title":215,"pubDate":237,"tags":238},"2022-11-11",[17,18],[],"2022/getting-out-of-your-comfort-zone",{"id":240,"data":242,"body":246,"filePath":247,"digest":248,"rendered":249},{"title":243,"pubDate":244,"tags":245},"Getting Out of Your Comfort Zone",["Date","2022-12-10T00:00:00.000Z"],[38,198,17],"When it comes to frameworks, I’ve been firmly stuck in the React–and React-adjacent–world.

One of the things that got me through that particularly tough change was a little game called The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I had played it the year previous on the Wii U, but I had finally upgraded to the Switch and was in the middle of my second play through when it all went down. I would spend a couple hours every day just aimlessly wandering around Hyrule, it made me feel a strange comfort. My sadness about the situation I found myself in melted away whenever I took these little virtual treks across the map, finding little nooks and crannies I’d never seen before.\n\nFast forward to last week, and I underwent another drastic life change; I moved from the apartment I’ve lived in for most of my adult life to a totally new place in a totally new city. I was, and still am, overwhelmed, homesick, and questioning all my decisions that led me to this point. Coincidentally, a little game called The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom dropped the day before I was to embark on this IRL adventure.\n\nMy first night in the new place involved staying up well past midnight diving into Hyrule once again, but this time it brought be a different kind of comfort. Fortuitously for me, Nintendo decided to reuse the world map from the previous game and just build upon it, and that has made this game feel a lot like coming home to me. Hyrule was a world that got me through a rough point in my life, and here it is again giving me a little taste of familiarity, of home, at a time when I need it the most.\n\nLast night I made a point to find a place Hateno Village, a town where you can buy a little house in Breath of the Wild. I wanted to visit it again, and see what had become of this virtual home-away-from-home. So, over the course of the evening I made my journey, and eventually came to the little house, sitting there at the edge of the village.

My sadness about the situation I found myself in melted away whenever I took these little virtual treks across the map, finding little nooks and crannies I’d never seen before.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fast forward to last week, and I underwent another drastic life change; I moved from the apartment I’ve lived in for most of my adult life to a totally new place in a totally new city. I was, and still am, overwhelmed, homesick, and questioning all my decisions that led me to this point. Coincidentally, a little game called The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom dropped the day before I was to embark on this IRL adventure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My first night in the new place involved staying up well past midnight diving into Hyrule once again, but this time it brought be a different kind of comfort. Fortuitously for me, Nintendo decided to reuse the world map from the previous game and just build upon it, and that has made this game feel a lot like coming home to me. Hyrule was a world that got me through a rough point in my life, and here it is again giving me a little taste of familiarity, of home, at a time when I need it the most.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Last night I made a point to find a place Hateno Village, a town where you can buy a little house in Breath of the Wild. I wanted to visit it again, and see what had become of this virtual home-away-from-home. So, over the course of the evening I made my journey, and eventually came to the little house, sitting there at the edge of the village. I walked inside, and, for the first time in a week, I felt at home.\u003C/p>",{"headings":327,"localImagePaths":328,"remoteImagePaths":329,"frontmatter":330,"imagePaths":333},[],[],[],{"title":318,"pubDate":331,"tags":332},"5/22/23",[169,18],[],"2023/journal-app-impressions",{"id":334,"data":336,"body":340,"filePath":341,"digest":342,"rendered":343},{"title":337,"pubDate":338,"tags":339},"Apple's Journal App: First Impressions",["Date","2023-11-12T05:00:00.000Z"],[39,115,18],"With the upcoming iOS 17.2 update, we’ll finally get our hands on the new Journal app Apple announced at WWDC earlier this year.

I played this game to death when it released, and spent countless hours searching the (admittedly small) game world seeking out secrets and collectables.\n\nThese 2 games are both well-regarded and loved among their respective fans. Both of them are quality, well-made games in their own right. But I've found myself enjoying the time I've spent replaying Minish Cap more than my time experiencing much of Metroid Prime for the first time. Is Minish Cap just more my style of game? Could it just be a better game? Or maybe my nostalgia is influencing my opinions.\n\nThere's also the fact that my first experience with the Wii version of Metroid Prime was suboptimal.

As a child of the 90's I grew up in the so-called \"Disney Renaissance\" and, as I've been re-exploring that era thanks to Disney Plus, I've found myself gravitating towards certain movies. Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan, Pocahontas, the Disney films I watched the most growing up, were the ones I enjoyed the most.

But on the other hand, would their opinions be colored by the ever-evolving experiences games have produced over the last 20 years?

We've seen such an influx of quality titles that it's been hard to even keep track, or even dedicate the time to the ones I have been able to keep track of. One of the two games that has really captured my attention – the other being Tears of the Kingdom – is Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nI’ve typically have had a difficult time getting invested in deep, Western-made RPGs, with the notable exception of The Witcher 3. The specific sub-genre that Baldur’s Gate 3 belongs to, the CRPG (or, Computer Role Playing Game) has been particularly challenging for me to latch on to.\n\nAround late-2020 or early-2021 I started playing Dungeons and Dragons remotely with a couple internet friends. It was in the midst of Covid, so we all had too much time to kill, and would spend a good chunk of our Sundays adventuring across the Forgotten Realms. I’d played D&D before, but it wasn’t something I really got into until that point.\n\nIf I didn’t have this experience I don’t think I would have been open to playing Baldur’s Gate. Because its mechanics are based on the same D&D rules I had spent hours immersed in every Sunday for nearly a year, I was going into the game already knowing the mechanics I usually find overwhelming and obtuse in these types of games.\n\nFor my first playthrough, I decided to port my wood elf ranger, the character I played as in the aforementioned remote D&D campaigns. I tried to recreate him as closely as the game allowed – Baldur’s Gate 3 actually uses a slightly modified version of the current D&D ruleset – and tried to role-play him the same. Basically my head canon was, after his previous adventures, he was thrust into this story.\n\nI never actually finished this playthrough. I got to the final story quest and decided to start over, I’d made so many mistakes, missed out on 3 major companions (Wyll, Karlach, and Halsin), and was only just getting comfortable with the freedom the game offers. Maybe someday I’ll finish my plucky wood elf’s journey, but until then...\n\nFor my second character, I chose to play as the Dark Urge. Unlike a purely custom character like I used for my first playthrough, the Dark Urge is not a blank slate, and has a story that interlinks with the game’s overall story.\n\nFor the Dark Urge I went with a human rogue, and I’ve had a lot more fun leaning into the game’s mechanics this time around. She’s basically a badass assassin, a master of deception, who disguises herself using this magical mask – which I got as part of the deluxe edition – to reach her targets.\n\nThis subtly altered my approach to the game in more ways than I had anticipated. For instance, during the early stages of the game, there's a quest to infiltrate a goblin camp and eliminate their three leaders. On both occasions, I successfully gained entry by persuading the goblins that I belonged to the nefarious cult that plays a significant role in the story. The first attempt required passing a series of deception checks, while during the second attempt, I employed the aforementioned magical mask to transform my character into a Drow – a race of dark elves – allowing me to waltz right into the camp.\n\nCarrying out the quest to take out the 3 goblin leaders played out quite a bit differently, at least on a mechanical level. The first time around I went in guns (er, arrows) blazing to take out the first 2 leaders, and then somehow convincing the 3rd I was on her side, leading her to a Druid grove, and having an all-out battle.\n\nThe second time I took full advantage of my party’s range of capabilities at that point, as well as the environment, to ambush the 3 leaders and get out with as little damage to my team as possible. I had a much easier time using this method, but it was so much more fulfilling to pull off. It didn’t feel cheap because I wasn’t cheesing the mechanics, I was figuring out how to best use them to my advantage.\n\nOn the surface, Baldur’s Gate 3 seems to share very little in common with Tears of the Kingdom, but I think it has enraptured me in much the same way. Both games not only allow you to push their mechanics to the limit to find your own solutions to the challenges they present you, but they make doing so extremely rewarding. These are games that are at their best when you think outside the box and get creative with the tools they give you.\n\nLast year I wrote about [my 3 favorite games of 2022](/posts/2022/my-top-3-games-of-2022) with the intention of doing a similar thing this year, but I don’t think I can. I’ve played a few games that could be the 3rd game in a potential “3 Favorite Games of 2023”, Sea of Stars, Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor come to mind, and while they’re all very good games worthy of the spot, they just didn't come close to impacting me in the same way.\n\nTears of the Kingdom [gave me a place to feel at home](/posts/2023/finding-home-in-hyrule) at a time when I felt out of place after moving apartments.

Mostly Star Trek, some Star Wars, and 1 or 2 model planes. It was sort of a continuation of my Lego obsession from my pre-teen days, but at some point I just kind of fell of. Fast-forward Summer 2022, I was going through a rough patch and wanted to focus on some hobbies that would get me away from the screen, and I decided to pick up model building again. Because the YouTube algorithm is a thing, as I watched more and more reviews and tutorials, I naturally ended up in a strange corner of the model kit scene called Gunpla.\n\nSo, what the heck is Gunpla? Best I can understand is that it's a portmanteau of [Gundam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam) and plastic. So simply put, it's about building robots (sorry, mecha) out of plastic.\n\nI've never been a Gundam fan, the genre just never really appealed to me. But I became enamored with watching Gunpla videos on YouTube, which is a whole genre of ASMR-like videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq88NAAD25k). The level of engineering behind these kits was just so fascinating to me, but I'm not super big on buying merch for franchises I don't really enjoy. Happily, that ended up not being a problem.\n\nSo, there was a little anime I watched back in high school called [Full Metal Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Panic!) which, like Gundam, features people piloting giant mecha. As luck would have it, Bandai, the makers of Gunpla kits, have/had the license to make kits for the series. Not-so-luckily, the kit I wanted based on the main character's mech is impossible to find at a reasonable price at the moment, so I settled for my second pick:\n\n![a box sitting on a table with an image of a mech and text that reads 'M9 Gernsback ver IV (Agressor Squadron)'](src/assets/blog/gunpla/box.jpg)\n\nSo, with the kit in hand, I opened the box and was greeted by a handful of plastic pouches containing what seemed like a thousand parts connected on plastic sprues in a variety of blues and grays. I took out the contents and perused through the included instructions, which read very much like it was designed by Ikea, if Ikea sold miniature giant robots. The writing was all in Japanese, but the illustrations were enough to guide one through the process no matter what language they can read.\n\n![neatly piled plastic sprues sorted by color, an instruction booklet, and a model of R2-D2 lurking in the corner](src/assets/blog/gunpla/all-the-parts.jpg)\n\nSeparating the individual pieces from each sprue was pretty painless. They came off very cleanly and I barely had to use my handy hobby knife to clean up bits of excess plastic, and when I did it cut through like butter. Not a drop of glue was needed, everything snapped together perfectly. I struggled a bit with the smaller parts (of which there were plenty), and there were a couple seemingly microscopic stickers I had to apply, so my iFixIt tweezers came in handy quite a few times.\n\nAfter a couple hours, I had a pretty sweet looking miniature mecha.\n\n![the finished model, standing tall, and holding a scary looking gun](src/assets/blog/gunpla/final.jpg)\n\nPutting it together, I was just so amazed by the level of engineering that went into this kit. Putting it all together, I could tell someone put a lot of care and attention into designing this thing, rivaling some of the Lego kits I've built, from the near-seamless fit of all the pieces, to the various types of joints enabling a quite frankly insane level of pose-ability for something this size.\n\nI had a lot of fun doing this, and it was cool to see what this little subculture of model building is like. Would I build another one? For sure, but I don't think it will be a regular thing for me because of how expensive it could get. This kit cost me around $50, and I tend to go hard on stuff like this (see my obscene collection of 2016-2017-era Magic The Gathering cards), so I could see myself spending way too much money on this if I'm not careful.\n\nI'm sure I'll get another kit eventually, but in the meantime there's a seemingly infinite number of those ASMR-style assembly videos, so I can marvel at the the engineering behind these kits second-hand for now.","src/content/blog/2023/my-gunpla-adventure.md",[458,459,460],"src/assets/blog/gunpla/box.jpg","src/assets/blog/gunpla/all-the-parts.jpg","src/assets/blog/gunpla/final.jpg","0d5b9fc581cc4ddd",{"html":463,"metadata":464},"\u003Cp>Back in my teenage years I used to build model kits.

Best I can understand is that it’s a portmanteau of \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam\">Gundam\u003C/a> and plastic. So simply put, it’s about building robots (sorry, mecha) out of plastic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve never been a Gundam fan, the genre just never really appealed to me. But I became enamored with watching Gunpla videos on YouTube, which is a whole genre of ASMR-like videos like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq88NAAD25k\">this one\u003C/a>. The level of engineering behind these kits was just so fascinating to me, but I’m not super big on buying merch for franchises I don’t really enjoy. Happily, that ended up not being a problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, there was a little anime I watched back in high school called \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Panic!\">Full Metal Panic\u003C/a> which, like Gundam, features people piloting giant mecha. As luck would have it, Bandai, the makers of Gunpla kits, have/had the license to make kits for the series. Not-so-luckily, the kit I wanted based on the main character’s mech is impossible to find at a reasonable price at the moment, so I settled for my second pick:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;src/assets/blog/gunpla/box.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;a box sitting on a table with an image of a mech and text that reads &#x27;M9 Gernsback ver IV (Agressor Squadron)&#x27;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, with the kit in hand, I opened the box and was greeted by a handful of plastic pouches containing what seemed like a thousand parts connected on plastic sprues in a variety of blues and grays. I took out the contents and perused through the included instructions, which read very much like it was designed by Ikea, if Ikea sold miniature giant robots. The writing was all in Japanese, but the illustrations were enough to guide one through the process no matter what language they can read.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;src/assets/blog/gunpla/all-the-parts.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;neatly piled plastic sprues sorted by color, an instruction booklet, and a model of R2-D2 lurking in the corner&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Separating the individual pieces from each sprue was pretty painless. They came off very cleanly and I barely had to use my handy hobby knife to clean up bits of excess plastic, and when I did it cut through like butter. Not a drop of glue was needed, everything snapped together perfectly. I struggled a bit with the smaller parts (of which there were plenty), and there were a couple seemingly microscopic stickers I had to apply, so my iFixIt tweezers came in handy quite a few times.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After a couple hours, I had a pretty sweet looking miniature mecha.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;src/assets/blog/gunpla/final.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;the finished model, standing tall, and holding a scary looking gun&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Putting it together, I was just so amazed by the level of engineering that went into this kit. Putting it all together, I could tell someone put a lot of care and attention into designing this thing, rivaling some of the Lego kits I’ve built, from the near-seamless fit of all the pieces, to the various types of joints enabling a quite frankly insane level of pose-ability for something this size.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a lot of fun doing this, and it was cool to see what this little subculture of model building is like. Would I build another one? For sure, but I don’t think it will be a regular thing for me because of how expensive it could get. This kit cost me around $50, and I tend to go hard on stuff like this (see my obscene collection of 2016-2017-era Magic The Gathering cards), so I could see myself spending way too much money on this if I’m not careful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’m sure I’ll get another kit eventually, but in the meantime there’s a seemingly infinite number of those ASMR-style assembly videos, so I can marvel at the the engineering behind these kits second-hand for now.\u003C/p>",{"headings":465,"localImagePaths":466,"remoteImagePaths":467,"frontmatter":468,"imagePaths":471},[],[458,459,460],[],{"title":452,"pubDate":469,"tags":470},"2023-01-28",[61],[458,459,460],"2023/on-using-chat-gpt",{"id":472,"data":474,"body":479,"filePath":480,"digest":481,"rendered":482},{"title":475,"pubDate":476,"tags":477},"Quick Thoughts On Using Chat GPT as a Coding Assistant",["Date","2023-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"],[198,478],"Programming","When I was learning to code, the line my tutor kept repeating was, “Half of programming is knowing how to use Google.” That can be pretty much boiled down to half of programming is knowing how to look things up, whether that’s in a book, online, or with a language model.

Some bugs introduced in the betas from last year, for example the infamous launch item notification bug, are _still_ present in the currently shipping version (13.4). Then there’s the mess that is System Settings, which received a major redesign last year for the first time since the Mac OS X betas from 23 years ago.\n\nThen there are some long-standing issues, like a memory leak in the WindowServer system process that has existed since at least Monterey in 2021 (though I feel like I’ve been experiencing it longer). Or the fact that the TV app straight up doesn’t work most of the time.\n\nThen there’s Launchpad (which may not be long for this world as the dedicated key on Apple’s keyboard has been replaced with Spotlight) which I’ve tried to use since it was introduced in Mac OS X Lion all the way back in 2010, but has a bug that will randomly just reorder the icons, which has been an issue since day 1.\n\nOne other long-standing issue that I’ve experienced is how unreliable network drives are. I have a Mac Mini set up as a home server, and the amount of times it’ll just fail to connect when I need to access one of the drives, or Time Machine just fails to recognize that there’s a network volume, is exceedingly frustrating.\n\nThe reliability of macOS varies so much from person to person.

In order to access the API, an app first needs to authenticate with their server by sending a pair of authentication keys and receiving back a special “bearer token”. This token can then be used to access the API itself, but as a developer my app can only request a very limited number of tokens at a time across all instances. That’s not a problem if you have only a couple users, but it could become one very quickly if say I had even 50 people using my app. So the best way around that is to set up a proxy server for the app to communicate with instead, and essentially let all users share the same token.\n\nI was feeling super discouraged. I don’t think I wrote a single line of code for QuestLogger throughout the month of July. Then, in early August, I decided I didn’t want all the work I put into the app go to waste, so I had the idea to convert the whole thing into a Mac app and release it as an open source project.\n\nI think this change allows the project to be a lot more flexible.

I liked the promise of carrying my existing music library into the world of music streaming, and having everything sync seamlessly between devices. I was very frustrated with how buggy and unreliable syncing music to iOS devices at the time (keep reading to find out if this will bite me in the butt again), so an all-you-can-eat buffet of music, combined with what was promised to be a seamless syncing method, was far too good to pass up.\n\n## The Final Straw\n\nHistorically I've been quite meticulous with how I organize my music – though I know there are people _far_ more meticulous than I am. That includes changing metadata for things like genre, because I don't need 15 variations on \"Alternative\" when just one will do. I also like changing track titles to remove extraneous information that could be gleaned from the metadata, like featured artist. Turns out, Apple Music does NOT like this, and it's a constant fight to keep things the way I like them.\n\nBut, even if you decide to throw in the towel like I eventually did, Apple Music often doesn't even like _its own_ metadata. Instead of just leaving things you've added to your library alone, it will just randomly change things around, which would be ok except it often doesn't propagate correctly, which leads to albums being split (at least, that's my theory as to why it happens). I even had it change album art to something completely unrelated to the album.\n\nWhat finally broke me however was when an album I had imported – not even from the iTunes Store, I got it in a Humble Music Bundle over a decade ago – became \"unavailable to play\". At some point in the last decade, Apple Music must have co-opted that album and then, when it was taken off streaming, decided I could no longer have access to it.\n\nOne thing became clear; with Apple Music, I don't even own the music that I own. Maybe I should have seen this coming, but better late than never I suppose.\n\n## Libera Musica\n\nAnyway, I began my quest to liberate my music, but it wasn't without issue. As I mentioned, at some point Apple Music co-opted a chunk of my music. There was no rhyme or reason to which albums, or even which individual tracks, got absorbed into the streaming machine. This meant a non-insignificant portion of my music was either just unavailable, or imprisoned behind DRM. Yes, that means Apple locked music I own and imported into their service behind a subscription!!! That's when I knew I was making the right call...\n\nMy first step was to see how much music I could rescue just by downloading the tracks that remained untouched and DRM-free. This is where I ran into the next major issue, but this time it was mostly my fault, and I could have saved myself _hours_ if I spent more time troubleshooting. See, a huge number of tracks downloaded as weird `.movpkg` files, which I couldn't really do anything with.\n\nTurns out, if I had just turned off \"Enable Lossless Audio\" in the Music app's settings, under the \"Playback\" tab, I could have saved myself a lot of time and headache...\n\nHowever, the silver lining is that, while I was downloading the handful of albums I purchased from Amazon over the years, I discovered that just about every vinyl record I ever bought from them was made available as a DRM-free digital download. A nice little bonus, considering it gave me a little bit of a head start on buying some music I only had access to through my subscription.\n\n## 8,000 Songs In My Pocket\n\nNow that I had my music all together, I needed some way to (obsessively) manage it all, and get it synced to my phone.\n\nI had hope that someone at Apple found it in their heart to fix the music syncing issues that cropped up in iOS well over a decade ago. Nope, apparently it's even worse, and a quick web search showed me I'm not imagining it. I'd also ruled out iTunes Match out the gate, because of the sub-par experience I had with it, and if they hadn't fixed manual syncing, I wasn't going to spend $25 to see if they fixed iTunes Match. The product page that clearly hasn't been touched since 2011 didn't inspire much confidence either.\n\nIf I wanted something reliable, I would have to look outside the slowly deteriorating mess that is Apple's music infrastructure.\n\nAfter a bit of searching, I came across an app called [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/), for both iPhone and Mac. I've been trying it out, and it's been a pretty solid experience so far. It's a simpler app, but I think that works to its benefit. Getting music from the Mac to the iPhone using Doppler isn't as seamless as, say, getting music from iTunes to an iPod back in the day. It's for sure a more manual process. But it works, and can even be done wirelessly.\n\nIt sort of reminds me of loading music onto my first MP3 player back in like 2004, and I don't think I hate it. There's a certain charm to it, and I think it makes the whole process feel more intentional.

I think that was lost in the age of the smartphone, and even moreso since streaming really took hold.\n\nAm I romanticizing it a bit? Probably.

I decided to try and experiment with combining [MUI Base](https://mui.com/base/getting-started/overview/), the barebones version of the MUI library, with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to allow easier customization. Here's an overview of how I set up a test project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This writeup assumes you have some experience with Next.js, using the terminal, and ideally some experience with MUI and Tailwind.\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Next.js\n\nNothing special is going on here. You can use `npx create-next-app@latest` or `yarn create next-app` depending on which package manager you prefer. I personally like Yarn, so that's what I'll be using. If you use NPM though the commands are similar so you'll be able to follow along.\n\nFollow the prompts to set up your Next.js project. These are the choices I went with:\n\n- Project name: mui-tailwind\n- Typescript: No\n- ESLint: Yes\n- Use 'src/' directory: Yes\n- Experimental 'app/' directory: No\n\nI also chose not to set up any import aliases for now. These can be easily added later if you so choose.\n\nIt will take a few moments for Next.js to download and for the project to set up, but when that's done, cd into '/mui-tailwind' (or whatever you named the project).\n\n## Step 2: Install MUI Base & Tailwind\n\nInstalling MUI Base is simple. Just run `yarn add @mui/base`, and you're good to go. There will be some config to do later, but once the package is done installing we're ready to install Tailwind with `yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`.\n\nOnce both MUI Base and Tailwind are installed, we next need to run `yarn tailwindcss init -p`, which will create 2 files, one called 'tailwind.config.js', and another called 'postcss.config.js'. Now we're ready to do some setup.\n\n## Step 3: Configuration\n\nFirst thing's first, open up the project folder in your code editor of choice and at the root of the project you should see the 'tailwind.config.js' we created in step 2. Open that, and under `module.exports` you should see an empty array named 'content'. Add the following to the array: `'./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'` Your config file should look like this:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"src/assets/blog/mui-plus-tailwind/tailwind-config.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"module.exports = { content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [],};\">\n\nNext, we need to import Tailwind into our 'globals.css' file, which is located in 'src/styles/'. We can delete everything in the file as we won't be needing any of it. Then, add the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"src/assets/blog/mui-plus-tailwind/global-css.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;\">\n\nAnd that's it! We're ready to start creating something!\n\n## Step 4: Creating Your First Component\n\nIdeally, we'd want to create smaller, reusable component files, but that's beyond the scope of this post, and is something you're most likely already familiar with if you have any experience with Next.js. Instead, we're going to work entirely in 'src/pages/index.js'.\n\nFirst, we should delete everything we don't need so that our 'index.js' file looks like this:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"src/assets/blog/mui-plus-tailwind/index-js.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"export default function Home() { return() }\">\n\nWe're going to create a simple button, nothing too fancy. So first we need to import the MUI Unstyled Button component by adding `import { ButtonUnstyled as Button } from '@mui/base'` on the first line of our file.\n\n_Note: The official MUI docs say to import as `import ButtonUnstyled from '@mui/base/ButtonUnstyled'`, which also works, but I prefer to use destructing which allows you to import multiple components with a single import statement'_\n\nNow we can create our button. Inside the return statement, add the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"src/assets/blog/mui-plus-tailwind/unstyled-button-code.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"\u003CButton>Click Me!\u003C/Button>\" />\n\nNext, go back to your terminal and run `yarn dev` to start up the dev server, and click the 'localhost' link that appears (most likely 'localhost:3000'). We'll be greeted by what looks like just a bit of text (it's a button, I promise), which isn't what we want, but that's because we haven't added any styles yet!\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"src/assets/blog/mui-plus-tailwind/unstyled-button.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"A plain old 'button' that reads 'Click Me!'\" />\n\nAll we need to do is add the `className` prop with some nice Tailwind utility classes:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"src/assets/blog/mui-plus-tailwind/styled-button-code.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"\u003CButton className='rounded-lg border-2 border-sky-500 bg-sky-600 py-2 px-10 font-medium text-slate-300 shadow hover:bg-sky-700 active:translate-y-0.5'>\n  Click Me!\n\u003C/Button>\" />\n\nNow, when we go back to the browser, we should see the following:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"src/assets/blog/mui-plus-tailwind/styled-button.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"A styled blue button that reads 'Click Me!'\" />\n\nNice! That looks a lot more like a button.\n\n## Step 5: Further Reading\n\nThis tutorial is just the basics of setting up a project using Next.js, MUI Base, and Tailwind. Of course, there's so much more to all these tools than I can possibly cover. For a more in-depth overview, I recommend you check out [this documentation](https://mui.com/base/guides/working-with-tailwind-css/) for using MUI Base with Tailwind, which I used as the basis for this guide, in combination with [this documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) for using Tailwind with Next.js.\n\nOf course, the documentation I linked to at the top of this post is also suggested reading if you're not familiar with any of what I've written about here.","src/content/blog/2023/using-tailwind-with-mui-base.md","3dd8d37931add1bc",{"html":646,"metadata":647},"\u003Cp>I’ve had some frustration lately working with \u003Ca href=\"https://mui.com\">MUI\u003C/a>, a styled component library for React.

On a personal level, I lost my job and have been scrambling to find one for over 6 months now. More importantly though, it's just felt like the world has been constantly on fire, and AI has been quickly turning everything good about the human experience into souless slop. That being said, it's not all bad, and I wanted to reflect on my favorite things/moments in 2025.\n\nI won't be talking any video games, as I [already covered that](/blog/2025/my-top-3-games-of-2025).\n\n## Catching Up On Movies\n\nOne positive that came from me losing my job was that I finally had the desire to watch movies again. Seeing as my job involved me being in front of a screen for 8 hours, I was very selective about how I spent my screen time outside of work, and that time primarily went to gaming. But over the last 6 months I've watched more movies than I had in a long time. These are some of my favorites:\n\n- The Batman\n- Kiki's Delivery Service\n- The Life of Chuck\n- Edge of Tomorrow\n\nThough only one is from 2025 (The Life of Chuck), these are all movies I watched for the first time last year.\n\n## Taskmaster Series 19 - 20\n\nOn the topic of watching things, 2025 saw 2 new ~~seasons~~ series of Taskmaster, and they both had some of my favorite lineups in the show.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, we also got the 4th Champion of Champions, where the previous 5 winners compete against eachother. While it wasn't the strongest in terms of the actual tasks, the lineup made it work. Even Sam Campbell, who's brand of humor generally wasn't really to my taste in series 16, got a few chuckles out of me. \n\n![](src/assets/blog/gifs/destroy-taskmaster.gif)\n\n## Music\n\n2025 wasn't a huge year for me in terms of music, but there were a couple albums that stood out for me. \n\nFirst, Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party from Hayley Williams was a standout as my most played album released this year, and might actually be my most played overall. Some standout tracks to me are \"Kill Me\", \"Mirtazapine\", and \"True Believer\".\n\nSecond, the soundtrack to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33[^1] is some of the most beautiful game music I've heard. It's up there with Journey, Nier Replicant, and The Witcher 3 for me. Like many others, I'm obsessed with the track \"Lumière\". But, another standout for me is \"Flying Waters - Rain From The Ground\", which brings in a synth track which sounds like a terrible idea on paper, but just adds to the odd atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe end of 2025 also saw the beginnings of my project to liberate my music library, and give up streaming altogether – much to the chagrin of my Mastodon followers, who have been bombarded with my grievences on the horrors of Apple Music.\n\n## The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship\n\nI've played a lot of different board games in 2025, but the new release from the past year that I enjoyed the most was The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship. It's yet another game designed around the core mechanics of Pandemic, but it introduced enough to make if feel distinct, but not overbloated (looking at you, World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Litch King).\n\nI tend to not enjoy board games based on existing IPs but, being a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings, I had to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. \n\n## Learning New Stuff\n\nLast year was a year of learning for me, right from the get-go. In January I created an app called AutoDock, which involved me diving deeper into Mac development than I have in previous years, diving into system APIs to detect display changes - mainly resolution changes, and external displays getting connected/disconnected.\n\nI also expanded my horizons in the world of web development. I've primarily been a React developer, and, though I was aware of other frameworks, I never had the time or motivation to dive into them. But over the last 6 months I got up to speed with SolidJS and Svelte, and I've got pretty comfortable using them.\n\nIn addition to all that, I learned the basics of other languages: Rust, Go, and Ruby. While I wouldn't say I gained proficiency in any of those languages, I did gain a better understanding of things like memory management, and I think I'm going into 2026 a much better programmer than I was a year ago.\n\nI also learned how to play croquet over the Summer, though I clearly need a lot of practice if I ever want to be moderately okay at it.\n\n[^1]: I said I wouldn't be talking about _video games_.

I thought it would be nice to be able to write and compile a fully-functional Mac application using any text editor, and without having to open Xcode.\n\nSo, I decided to try migrating my app, [AutoDock](https://github.com/ghall89/AutoDock), to this Xcode-free build process, and actually release it as the next update. I have a few requirements for this to be viable:\n\n1. Whichever editor I use, I need access to the Swift language server.\n2. The build process should produce a functional MacOS application bundle as a universal binary (for both Intel and ARM CPUs).\n3. I should be able to use regular security features available to apps built with Xcode, like sandboxing, hardened runtime, etc.\n4. The final binary should be signed with my developer certificate.\n\nTo prevent this blog post from being far too long, I’ve decided to split it up into multiple parts. This first part will focus on LSP support, and building the application bundle.\n\n## Setting Up the Swift Language Server\n\nBeing the Mac nerd that I am, I felt it would be uncouth to not even try using BBEdit for writing and editing the actual Swift code. Thankfully, BBEdit has some pretty nice LSP support built in, so it was simply a matter of creating a symlink to the Swift language server in BBEdit’s ‘Language Servers’ directory:\n\n`ln -s -f /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/sourcekit-lsp ~/Library/Application\\ Support/BBEdit/Language\\ Servers/sourcekit-lsp`\n\n~~However, I found it to be a tad slow, so~~[^1] I opted for the lazy route and just installed [Zed’s Swift extension](https://github.com/zed-extensions/swift). There is also [one for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=swiftlang.swift-vscode), for anyone who wants to go that route.\n\nHowever, now that I have it set up in BBEdit, I could just jump in and edit a file quickly if needed.\n\n## Building the Application Bundle\n\nWith a bit of research, I found this tool called [Swift Bundler](https://swiftbundler.dev/). While it's possible to make it all work without this tool, it enables you to configure your app bundle with a simple .toml file, and will even scaffold out a starter project for you based on [a variety of templates](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler-templates).\n\nI created a new SwiftUI project with it, and copied the source code for AutoDock into the project. I also created a Taskfile.yml for my go-to task-runner, simply named [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) for running the various commands. This will especially come in handy for the later steps.\n\nAside from an error being thrown during build due to a possible race condition in my code (don’t know why Xcode never caught this 🤷‍♂️), everything worked almost perfectly. The only issues I ran into were the Dock icon not hiding (AutoDock is a menubar-based application), and the app not seeing the user preferences from the Xcode build.\n\nThe first issue was down to an issue with the documentation, or perhaps my misunderstanding of it. In order to add additional properties to the application’s Info.plist, such as setting `LSUIElement` to `true` for hiding the app’s Dock icon. My read of the documentation was that I should add the following to the `Bundler.toml`:\n\n```\n[apps.AutoDock.plist]\nLSUIElement = \"True\"\n```\n\nHowever, upon doing a bit of digging, I found this was the correct way to add it:\n\n```\n[apps.AutoDock.extra_plist_entries]\nLSUIElement = \"True\"\n```\n\nThe second issue, the new build of AutoDock not being able to see the user settings from the Xcode build, is something I will have to dive into later, since I have the app in a state that I can begin testing in my everyday usage.\n\nOne huge benefit I noticed immediately was a significant reduction in bundle size. The Xcode build of AutoDock clocks in at 2 MB, which is by no means huge, but dwarfs the new build which clocks in at just 670 KB.

While it’s possible to make it all work without this tool, it enables you to configure your app bundle with a simple .toml file, and will even scaffold out a starter project for you based on \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler-templates\">a variety of templates\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I created a new SwiftUI project with it, and copied the source code for AutoDock into the project. I also created a Taskfile.yml for my go-to task-runner, simply named \u003Ca href=\"https://taskfile.dev/\">Task\u003C/a> for running the various commands. This will especially come in handy for the later steps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Aside from an error being thrown during build due to a possible race condition in my code (don’t know why Xcode never caught this 🤷‍♂️), everything worked almost perfectly. The only issues I ran into were the Dock icon not hiding (AutoDock is a menubar-based application), and the app not seeing the user preferences from the Xcode build.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first issue was down to an issue with the documentation, or perhaps my misunderstanding of it. In order to add additional properties to the application’s Info.plist, such as setting \u003Ccode>LSUIElement\u003C/code> to \u003Ccode>true\u003C/code> for hiding the app’s Dock icon.

The Xcode build of AutoDock clocks in at 2 MB, which is by no means huge, but dwarfs the new build which clocks in at just 670 KB.

This part will focus on code signing, and uploading the application bundle to Apple for notarization so it can be distributed.\n\n## Code Signing\n\nIf you’re going to be distributing your app, it’s important to have it signed and notarized for the security of your app and its users. This process adds a digital certificate to your app that becomes invalidated if your app is ever modified by, for example, a malicious actor. It also can be revoked by Apple if you’re found to be distributing malware, which you, if you’re not a scumbag, won’t have to worry about. 🙂\n\nThis, I thought, was going to be the most annoying part of working outside of Xcode. Apple does provide `codesign` and `notarytool` as part of the Xcode CLI Tools, but I just assumed using them would be a headache.\n\nIn order to sign an application, you need a certificate and, due to me not really knowing what I was doing, this was where I ran into trouble. I tried using my Apple Distribution certificate, which made intuitive sense to me at the time, and I didn’t run into any issues at first. I didn’t run into any errors, and verifying the signature showed everything as a-okay. So I continued...\n\n## Notarization\n\nFor notarization, you have to use `notarytool` to upload either a ZIP file or a DMG disk image containing your application to Apple. I opted to go with a disk image, mainly because that was the method that was being used in the various Stack Overflow threads I came across. So, I created the disk image (I opted to use [create-dmg](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg) to automate the process), and uploaded it to Apple. After a few moments, I received a response that my app was invalid.\n\nI reached out for help on Mastodon, and [Dmitry Rodionov](https://mastodon.social/@rodionovd), a developer at [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), was kind enough to point me in the right direction. Turns out, the Apple Distribution certificate I was using not what I should be using, what I needed to to was create a Developer ID Application certificate – which was the only part of this whole process I used Xcode for - and use that instead.\n\nI also want to shout out [David Bureš](https://mstdn.social/@davidbures), developer of [Cork]() – a must-have app if you use Homebrew – who’s response to my initial post asking for help is, I believe, how Dmitry found me. (I could be wrong, I just don’t want to leave anybody out 🙂)\n\nSo, I re-signed my application, created a new disk image, and uploaded that to be notarized by Apple, and just a few moments later I got a successful!\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nDespite the challenges and quirks with trying to create Mac apps outside of Xcode, I think this is the process I’m sticking with going forward. The freedom to use the kinds of tools I’m more comfortable with is worth the drawbacks for me.\n\nHowever, if I weren’t simply developing Mac apps as a hobby, and I didn’t enjoy the act of tinkering, I might be looking at those drawbacks very differently. It would be interesting to explore ways the developer experience can be improved, but that will have to be a project for another time.\n\nFinally, for those who are interested in digging more into how I got this all to work, and perhaps follow my crazy example, I’ve created a [template repo on GitHub](https://github.com/ghall89/mac-app-template) you can check out.","src/content/blog/2025/building-a-mac-app-without-xcode-part-2.md","3c9eb28cb7bc16f4",{"html":801,"metadata":802},"\u003Cp>While I enjoy developing Mac apps, I find Xcode to be exceptionally clunky, especially when compared to the tools I use for web development.

Here's the 5 I've whittled my list down to, with the disclaimer that I don't necessarily like them more than other albums that didn't make the cut.\n\n- The Else - They Might Be Giants\n- Ocean Eyes - Owl City\n- Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand\n- Hey, I'm Just Like You - Tegan and Sara\n- White Blood Cells - The White Stripes\n\n## What Are 5 Of Your Favorite Songs?\n\nDitto for songs, but 100x more difficult...\n\n- Synopsis for Latecomers - They Might Be Giants\n- What Feels Like Eternity - Metric\n- The Last Great American Dynasty - Taylor Swift\n- This is Why - Paramore\n- Good Morning Tucson - Jonathan Coulton\n\n## Favorite Instrument(s)?\n\nI used to play the trumpet, so that's probably my favorite. After that, probably keyboard because I think it would be fun to play.\n\n## What Song Or Album Are You Currently Listening To?\n\nAs I write this, I am listening to Poké & Chill, which is an album of lo-fi renditions of music from the Pokémon video games.\n\n## Do You Listen To The Radio, And If So, How Often?\n\nI don't listen to the radio at all anymore. The one station I did listen to closed and got sold off years ago, and so my days of listening to the radio ended.\n\n## How Often Do You Listen To Music?\n\nAlmost constantly. I sometimes substitute it out for podcasts, but I'm generally listening to music while I work, clean, or just relax. I also listen to music while I write, but I generally only listen to various lo-fi albums.\n\n## How Often Do You Discover Music And How Do You Discover It?\n\nI don't discover as much new music as I would like to, but when I do it's through Apple Music in the New section, or from listening to some of their recommended playlists.\n\n## What’s A Song Or Album You Enjoy That You Wish Had More Recognition?\n\nI'm absolutely 100% biased here since I know the artist, but my pick is [Here's to the Sojourners](https://album.link/i/1598277466) by Nathan Landis Funk. Cool music by a cool guy.\n\n## What’s Your Favorite Song Of All Time?\n\nThis answer changes constantly, but at the moment I'd have to pick Birdhouse in Your Soul by They Might Be Giants. It's perhaps an odd choice, but it never fails to cheer me up when I'm feeling down and that's enough to cement it as my favorite...for the moment.\n\n## Has Your Taste Of Music Evolved Over The Years?\n\nI'd say it's expanded quite a bit, and I'd even say changed slighlty. I had a very limited taste in high school, and, while I still do like a lot of the music I listened to then, as my tastes have expanded I've found myself perferring a lot of different artists and genres. \"Alternative\" is still the most common genre in my Apple Music library, but over the last 16 years I've added electronic, folk, grunge, K-pop, and \"singer/songwriter\" (though I'm still not entirely sure what that means as a genre 🤷‍♂️).\n\nSo, after much overthinking, those are my answers to these musical questions.

As such, I spent most of 2025 replaying old favorites, or finally finishing games that have been sitting in my backlog for ages.\n\nSo, my top 3 list this year is going to be very skewed towards early 2025, as the only post-June release I’ve even got to play was Hades II. So yes, from what I’ve seen, if I’d been able to pick up Ghost of Yōtei, it would have probably made this list.\n\n## Hades II\n\nI’m not a big rogue-like fan, but I did enjoy the original Hades back in 2020 (despite not actually finishing it), so I was very excited for the sequel. Unlike many rogue-likes that I've played, Hades has a very nice sense of progression, and Hades II expands on that in fun and interesting ways.\n\nIn my gaming journal, I had a hard time identifying what really grabbed me about this game that led me to actually finish it. But, upon further reflection, I think it's a combination of the more interesting progression system, and the fact that there were two paths to follow – a path down to Tarturus, and another up to Mount Olympus. This added enough gameplay variety that, when I was bored with o path, I'd just switch to trying to make progress in another.\n\nI also enjoyed the concrete goals, outside of the main objective of defeating Chronos, via \"prophecies\". It made me feel like I was accomplishing things even when failing runs, and they continue to keep me invested in playing even though I've finished the main story. \n\n## Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\n\nClair Obcur, in many ways, feels like the natural evolution Final Fantasy could have taken in another universe where they stuck with turn-based combat. Though visually, and in terms of story, it's very much its own thing. \n\nTo say this game has ruined turn-based JRPG style games for me is far from an understatement. Each party memeber not only has their own set of skills, they also have unique mechanics that make each feel very distinct, and makes combat strategy far more interesting than just picking a character's best skill for a given situation. Maelle is probably my favorite, with her stances that are applied by using certain moves – usually alongside some otehr condition – and apply different effects, like, \"Deal 50% more damage, but take 50% more damage\". \n\nI liked pretty much all the characters, which is a rarity for me.

As such, I spent most of 2025 replaying old favorites, or finally finishing games that have been sitting in my backlog for ages.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, my top 3 list this year is going to be very skewed towards early 2025, as the only post-June release I’ve even got to play was Hades II. So yes, from what I’ve seen, if I’d been able to pick up Ghost of Yōtei, it would have probably made this list.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"hades-ii\">Hades II\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I’m not a big rogue-like fan, but I did enjoy the original Hades back in 2020 (despite not actually finishing it), so I was very excited for the sequel. Unlike many rogue-likes that I’ve played, Hades has a very nice sense of progression, and Hades II expands on that in fun and interesting ways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my gaming journal, I had a hard time identifying what really grabbed me about this game that led me to actually finish it. But, upon further reflection, I think it’s a combination of the more interesting progression system, and the fact that there were two paths to follow – a path down to Tarturus, and another up to Mount Olympus. This added enough gameplay variety that, when I was bored with o path, I’d just switch to trying to make progress in another.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also enjoyed the concrete goals, outside of the main objective of defeating Chronos, via “prophecies”. It made me feel like I was accomplishing things even when failing runs, and they continue to keep me invested in playing even though I’ve finished the main story.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"clair-obscur-expedition-33\">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Clair Obcur, in many ways, feels like the natural evolution Final Fantasy could have taken in another universe where they stuck with turn-based combat. Though visually, and in terms of story, it’s very much its own thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To say this game has ruined turn-based JRPG style games for me is far from an understatement. Each party memeber not only has their own set of skills, they also have unique mechanics that make each feel very distinct, and makes combat strategy far more interesting than just picking a character’s best skill for a given situation. Maelle is probably my favorite, with her stances that are applied by using certain moves – usually alongside some otehr condition – and apply different effects, like, “Deal 50% more damage, but take 50% more damage”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I liked pretty much all the characters, which is a rarity for me. Generally there’s one or two characters I cannot stand, but they’re all so likable, and you come to care about all their stories, which makes a certain choice at the end of the game very heartbreaking.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My favorite character overall though is Esquie, who serves as this game’s equivient of the classic Final Fantasy airship.

I was introduced to it via a co-worker during a screen share, and I pretty much instantly fell in love. It’s got its share of issues, but it’s served as an excellent replacement for Arc, which is now (for abundantly stupid reasons) a dead product.\n\nBetween Arc and Zen, I was using Vivaldi. I found the UI extremely clunky and frankly pretty ugly. And I had grown used to the idea of the collapsible sidebar of tabs, as well as different browsing contexts, things that fundamentally changed how I use a web browser. While Vivaldi had similar functionality, it was, not surprisingly, clunky and unintuitive.\n\nThat’s not to say Zen doesn’t have its share of clunkiness at times, it’s definitely not as polished as Arc was. But it’s always improving, and, even at its clunkiest, it’s nowhere near as unpleasant as Vivaldi’s UX. But it works great 95% of the time, and that’s quite impressive for a relatively young open-source project that’s not backed by a big tech company.\n\nUnlike Arc, and indeed unlike most browsers these days, Zen doesn’t use Chromium for its rendering engine. Instead, it uses Gecko, which is maintained by Mozilla, and used in their Firefox browser. This may be a downside for a lot of people, it’s not the most cutting edge in terms of web standards, but if it helps bring renewed interest in rendering engines not made by Apple or Google I see that as a major plus – I’ll spare the lecture on why I believe Chromium has become far too ubiquitous.\n\nOn the web dev side, I’ve found the developer tools to be…fine. I’ve used the Firefox dev tools in the past, so I’m comfortable with them, and it didn’t take me long to adjust. While I much prefer the Chromium dev tools (which is about the only thing I _like_ about Chromium), I don’t find the Gecko dev tools that much worse. Which is more than I can say about Safari’s dev tools. 😬\n\nAnother major positive is battery life. I’d become somewhat used to the less-than-ideal battery life I was getting with Arc, and slightly less so than Vivaldi. But after switching to Zen, I started to notice my battery was lasting quite a bit longer. As I write this (with Zen open in the background), my M2 MacBook Air is at about 88% battery, with 11 hours remaining. I know in practice it won’t _actually_ last 11 hours, but that’s higher than any estimation that I can recall ever getting using a Chromium-based browser. In practice, it means that, generally, depending on which Node environments I have to run locally that day, I can make it through an entire 8 hour workday, with a bit to spare.\n\nThe biggest downsides are the inability to access DRM’d content online, specifically on streaming services (I’ve been swapping to Safari to get my Andor and Doctor Who fix), and the fact that the iCloud Keychain extension doesn't work (though I've heard through the internet grapevine a fix is coming). Also, the fun – and I will admit, relatively obnoxious – animations on this site do not work, but that should be remedied whenever Firefox fully implements the View Transition API.\n\nAll in all, my experience with the Zen Browser has been positive, and, barring any unforeseen changes, I see myself sticking with it for the long haul.

No, I’ve been pondering its effects on human creativity, and our capacity to learn and grow as creative creatures.

Just over a month later, I posted a [follow up](https://ghall.blog/posts/2023/an-update-on-my-ai-dating-profile/), in which I said the following:\n\n> …it didn’t feel like I was presenting my authentic self. Yes, I vetted the text generated by the AI to ensure it wasn’t falsely representing me, but I still felt dirty. Like the few matches I did get weren’t matching with me, but with the AI. My profile may have been technically accurate to who I am as a person, but I felt somewhat removed from it.\n\nI’ve used AI on and off for different reasons since then. I’ve used it to help solve programming issues at work and on side projects, to generate images in various art styles that I don’t have the patience or talent to draw in, and even tinkered with it for writing letters. But I kept experiencing the same feelings I had from “creating” my AI dating profile; these creations were far more a product of the machine than my own humanity.\n\nIt can be–and has been–argued that generative AI democratizes creativity. A person who can barely draw a stick figure can create intricate works of art just by writing some words and feeding them into an algorithm. Or someone with no sense of rhythm or tune can make music that sounds clean and professional. As someone who lacks skill in both those areas (and many more), that sounds incredibly liberating.\n\nBut, the more I think about it, even when ignoring the plagiarism inherent in using generative AI, the more problematic it feels. Yes, generative AI is a tool like any other, and requires a human to operate it[^1], but at what point does a tool eclipse the creative input of the human behind it?\n\nArt, writing, any sort of creative output, is the result of our emotions, our thoughts, our experiences. Perhaps even more important is the journey we must take to create. We can’t be good at everything, and part of the joy of creation is finding the things that we can be good at, and honing that skill. The best painters in history didn’t wake up one day and start making masterpieces, the best writers didn’t start writing classics from the moment they put pen to paper, and the best photographers weren’t masters of framing when they picked up a camera for the first time.\n\nI would argue that Generative AI does not democratize art or self-expression. It enables us to create a hollow facsimile of those things, something that doesn’t truly express to the world who we are. If an AI wrote my blog posts, they might convey some broad thought or opinion I may share, but you wouldn’t be any closer to understanding how I truly feel about whatever it is I’m writing about.\n\nWhy does any of this even matter? Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t. But, I would argue that, whether it’s commercial art or just art for the sake of art, a personal blog or a best-selling novel, a side project or just a small piece of a larger piece of software, it’s the human element, the emotions and experiences of the creator, that makes any art worth creating or consuming.\n\nGenerative AI is already writing articles for publications like Sports Illustrated, creating motion graphics for shows like Marvel’s Secret Invasion, and being pushed into countless tools for creatives, developers, and designers. Even Apple, which has prided itself for decades on making products that appeal to artists, has got into the generative AI game with their upcoming Image Playground app.\n\nNone of this is to say AI has no place in our lives–I for one would love an AI to do my taxes, create meal plans, and handle whatever other drudgery we need to deal with. Like any tool, it should supplement, not replace, the human touch.\n\nThe question I think we need to ponder is this; Where do we draw the line?\n\nSurely, purely AI-generated works are a bridge too far. But is there room for AI to assist in the creative process, and to what extent? How do we strike a balance and use this tool in a way that maximizes its positive impact on our lives while minimizing the negative impact on society?

It was something I would dread doing, because if you wanted to something more complicated than a basic login form, it would quickly become a mess trying to manage state – because, of course, why would we use anything except controlled inputs?\n\nThere are libraries like Formik and TanStack Form which proclaim to take a lot of the headache out of building forms in React. While they do simplify managing state in our forms, they still involve managing state and utilizing controlled inputs, which comes with its own set of problems.\n\nTo get at why using state for forms is not ideal, we first have to look at how state works in React; Put simply, state is a value or set of values in a component that, when changed, cause the entire component to re-render in order to reflect that change.\n\nHopefully you can see where I'm going with this.\n\nWith a controlled component, whenever the user makes a change the entire form is re-rendered, which means that, essentially, every keystroke by the user causes a re-render. If you're building a login page, or even a simple contact form, you likely won't see much of a performance hit, but you're still very likely over-engineering the problem.\n\nEnter the useRef hook...\n\nI've been aware of useRef for most of my time using React, but I'd never really explored its use. I've got comfortable with the common hooks like useState, useMemo, and useEffect (which I could write another post about by itself), but useRef proved to be somewhat elusive to me for a time. That was until I started seeing content about using it instead of useState for storing form values.\n\nSee, the great thing about useRef, at least in this use case, is it doesn't cause re-renders, and, if the component does happen to get re-rendered, the values will persist. Full disclosure, you do lose some of the benefits of using state, like using the value of a reference as a dependency for a useMemo or useEffect hook, however, I feel that, in most cases, the pros outweigh the cons.\n\nOf course, you can still read the values stored by useRef in your submission logic, otherwise there would be no point in utilizing this approach. But this means you can still perform validation, either yourself or with a library like Zod, and whatever else you might want to do with that data. You could even set it to state if you so desired.\n\nIf you're looking for a starting point, I whipped up a quick, somewhat contrived, and not at all secure, login form using useRef instead of useState.

While they do simplify managing state in our forms, they still involve managing state and utilizing controlled inputs, which comes with its own set of problems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To get at why using state for forms is not ideal, we first have to look at how state works in React; Put simply, state is a value or set of values in a component that, when changed, cause the entire component to re-render in order to reflect that change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With a controlled component, whenever the user makes a change the entire form is re-rendered, which means that, essentially, every keystroke by the user causes a re-render. If you’re building a login page, or even a simple contact form, you likely won’t see much of a performance hit, but you’re still very likely over-engineering the problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Enter the useRef hook…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been aware of useRef for most of my time using React, but I’d never really explored its use. I’ve got comfortable with the common hooks like useState, useMemo, and useEffect (which I could write another post about by itself), but useRef proved to be somewhat elusive to me for a time. That was until I started seeing content about using it instead of useState for storing form values.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>See, the great thing about useRef, at least in this use case, is it doesn’t cause re-renders, and, if the component does happen to get re-rendered, the values will persist. Full disclosure, you do lose some of the benefits of using state, like using the value of a reference as a dependency for a useMemo or useEffect hook, however, I feel that, in most cases, the pros outweigh the cons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of course, you can still read the values stored by useRef in your submission logic, otherwise there would be no point in utilizing this approach. But this means you can still perform validation, either yourself or with a library like Zod, and whatever else you might want to do with that data. You could even set it to state if you so desired.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you’re looking for a starting point, I whipped up a quick, somewhat contrived, and not at all secure, login form using useRef instead of useState.

Specifically Fedora (via Asahi Linux) for those who are curious. I installed it on an M1 MacBook Air, which I keep around as an emergency backup, and I've been mostly pleased with how well it's been running.\n\nMost of the time I've spent with this Linux environment has just been tinkering, installing apps, and getting things like git and OhMyZSH set up and configured the way I like it. I haven't really had the chance to do anything productive or useful with it yet[^1], and so I don't have a fully informed opinion on the experience of using Linux as a daily driver. But I wanted to give my impressions, share potential difficulties I might have if I ever decide to make the full switch, and why I would even consider the possibility of making that switch.\n\nSo, to start, why am I even exploring Linux?\n\nWell, aside from my curiosity when it comes to all things tech, I'm also concerned about the direction of the Mac, and Apple as a company. Between the success of the iPhone, and the leadership of Tim Cook, I feel Apple has lost much of what made it special. I hesitate to use the words \"heart\" or \"soul\", since I don't think those words are appropriate for a corporation, and Apple has been a pretty corporate entity since the days of the Apple II, albeit one that [once flew a pirate flag on its campus](https://www.folklore.org/Pirate_Flag.html?sort=date?sort=date).\n\nWhile Apple certainly had its flaws under Steve Jobs, I struggle to see a reality where that Apple would have donated money to destroy part of an historical building for one man's vanity project, or given that same man a golden statue.\n\nAnd, even if you disagree with me on that, you can't deny that Apple's former attitude of \"build great products, and the money will follow\" has long since gone out the window. They still make world-class hardware, and I would argue that their Mac hardware is better than it has been in a _very_ long time, but their software has been slowly deteriorating. There was a time when Apple would delay software, especially a new OS, if it wasn't quite ready, and they wouldn't dream of aggressively pitching their various subscription services via notifications or system settings. Today's Apple will pump out multiple new OSes every September like clockwork, damn the consequences, and will prioritize whatever will bring more money to their coveted \"services revenue\".\n\nAnyway, that's my long-winded way of saying that, if current trends continue, making the jump to Linux seems more like a \"when\" than an \"if\". For the sake of the Mac, I hope things change, but I won't be overly optimistic unless there are some leadership changes at Apple.\n\nWhat do I think of Linux, then?\n\nThe thing that stands out to me the most about Linux is the level of customization, and while the default experience (in KDE Plasma at least) is very Windows-coded, that customization means I can craft something close to the Mac experience that I'm used to. I was able to do things like move the window controls to the left side, as God intended, and turn the top \"panel\" to something more akin to the macOS menu bar[^2].\n\nIt's also very fast. Granted, I am running it on an M1, and I don't have much in the way of background utilities and such running like I do on macOS, but Linux just feels so much more snappy and responsive. It doesn't seem like it's more memory-efficient than macOS, it seems to be using about 7ish GB of memory, out of the 8GB total in this MacBook, and even utilizing some swap, with just a web browser, terminal, and text editor open, but perhaps that's expected behavior on Linux.[^3]\n\nHowever, the largest barriers I can see to using Linux as a daily driver are the user experience, and the community.\n\nPerhaps this is due to the sheer level of customization on offer, but the Linux experience just doesn't compete with the Mac, even compared to macOS Tahoe. While I will admit my configuration looks a lot nicer to my eyes than the new Liquid Glass design, it's missing a lot of the little touches. Dragging windows feels slightly clunky in a way I'm not sure I can describe in words, and in many cases text rendering doesn't look as smooth or consistent. Also, many apps don't visually behave like you'd expect, like the aforementioned menu behavior, or they render their own window chrome, overriding the system and, as a result, your customizations.\n\nI also feel very much embedded in the Mac community, and that's a major aspect of what keeps me on the platform. From the many small companies and solo devs making great indie or open-source software, to the friends and acquaintances I've met online, and beyond. I'm sure much of that is some combination of tribalism and stereotypes, which, as we know, has _never_ been the source of close-minded attitudes (super big \"/s\" for those with broken sarcasm detectors). But that community is, I think, the lifeblood of the Mac, and it survived the dark days of 90's Apple, but if Apple continues to turn its nose up at that community I do wonder how much longer that community will be willing to stick around as much as it has been.\n\nGiven the course of Apple as a company, as well as its products, in addition to my own values around supporting and creating independant software, I feel it would be irresponsible of me to not keep tabs on Linux, and keep it in my back pocket as an alternative.\n\nI do, however, have some questions for the Linux community if any of you haven't been driven away from this post in anger or annoyance:\n\n- Is there a universal way to customize keyboard shortcuts to more closely match the Mac, for example making copy `command + C` instead of `control + C`?\n- Is there some setting I'm missing to tell apps with custom window chrome to respect the system settings? Same for displaying the \"Global Menu\".\n- Are there any decent app launchers like Raycast that have things like snippets and clipboard history?\n\nFeel free to reach out to me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ghalldev).\n\n[^1]: However, to continue my series of gimicky posts, like when I [wrote about the Mac using Mac OS 7](/blog/2024/ramblings-on-the-macintosh), and [wrote about taking intentional analog time with pen and paper](/blog/2025/intentional-analog-time), I'm writing this blog post in Linux.\n\n[^2]: This annoyingly does not work for all apps, but I'm probably missing something obvious.\n\n[^3]: Of note, the Plasma shell itself seems to be the most memory intensive process, using about 500MB of RAM, which seems more than reasonable.","src/content/blog/2025/tinkering-with-linux.md","acc9b60fd2680a97",{"html":1288,"metadata":1289},"\u003Cp>For the last 8 or 9 months, I’ve been experimenting on and off with Linux.

This is something I learned the hard way, a little over 10 years ago now, when I lost almost everything on a failed hard drive. Photos, school projects, personal projects, a bunch of terrible stories I wrote (to be fair, that last one wasn't a huge loss). It was then I decided to get serious about backing up, and scrounged up what little money I had at the time to buy a 500GB external drive.\n\nSince then, though my backup solution has evolved, I haven't lost a single bit of data. Outside of my own stupidity of course, but that's another story...\n\nMy current backup solution is 2-fold:\n\nFirst, my entire MacBook is backed up over my local network to an external 4TB drive connected to Mac Mini server using [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/).\n\nSecond, the Mac Mini server is then backed up to the cloud via [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/).\n\nTo complicate things a tad, I also have a 1TB external SSD connected to the Mac Mini which I use as extra storage for files I don't really need on my MacBook, but still want to keep. This SSD is also backed up to the 4TB drive (via another install of Carbon Copy Cloner), and is thus included in the Backblaze backup.\n\nI've opted to use Carbon Copy Cloner instead of Time Machine because it offers a lot more flexibility, both in scheduling and in how my backups are organized.\n\nFor example, the external SSD on the Mac Mini doesn't get written to a whole lot, so I have it scheduled to backup once a day. It's probably a little excessive for how often I actually need to save files there, but I figure it's better to backup more often than I actually need.\n\nOn my MacBook, I have it set to backup every 6 hours. I figured this was a good balance between safety and convenience. Most of my mission-critical work is code, which I commit to GitHub on a regular basis, and I'd rather not have to tie up my network every hour.\n\nFinally, I have both these backups separated into their own folders on the 4TB drive for organizational purposes, which I don't think is possible, or at least not that easy to set up, with Time Machine.\n\nBut my solution is not perfect, and I have identified a few weaknesses in my setup:\n\nFirstly, my backup is not bootable. This is more of a convenience than anything else, but because of how I have everything configured it's not possible to boot from my network backup.\n\nAlso, because my backups are over my local network, I can only backup from home. This isn't the end of the world since I don't often take my MacBook with me for more than a few hours but there have been instances where I've been away for a few days with it in tow. But again, it would be mostly an inconvenience because my mission-critical work gets pushed to GitHub regularly.\n\nThirdly, I don't have a great solution for keeping backups of my photos and anything else I have in iCloud. While both my local Photos library and the \"Mobile Documents\" folder–where macOS stores iCloud Drive locally–are included in the backup, the way iCloud handles files, and its overall reliability, makes me a little nervous. What if some of my photos are missing from the local library, or some document in my iCloud Drive isn't properly downloaded. I don't have a great solution to this, but I am open to suggestions. Please [hit me up on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ghalldev) if you have any.\n\nAnd finally, I don't have another offsite backup, so if my apartment burns down AND Backblaze for some reason loses all my data (which is an unlikely, but not impossible, scenario) I'm SOL. Even having a backup drive at a relative's house that I backup to once in a while would be better than relying entirely on local network backups and the cloud.\n\nBut if there's one thing I learned, and would like to impart on anyone who, in the year 2024, doesn't have a backup, is that _any_ backup is better than _no_ backup.

It got me thinking about some of my most formative video game experiences, and what shaped me into the gamer I am today.\n\nLike the postcast, I've picked 5 games I consider to be important to me personally. They're in no particular order, and they're not all my favorites, but they are the games that contributed most to my love of gaming.\n\n## Donkey Kong Country\n\nThis game hold a special place in my heart as my first ever video game. When I was 6, my dad bought me a Super Nintendo bundled with this game, and it blew my little mind. While I think its sequel, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, is the better game, the original still has a warm place in my heart, and I revisit it from time to time.\n\n## Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was young, and I wasn't really allowed to have a console at my mom's house. I was, however, allowed to have my GameBoy, which my mom bought for me alongside a copy of this game.\n\nIt's not what I'd call a favorite of mine–sorry to everyone who loves this game–but it was my first experience with portable gaming, and the start of my preference for that kind of experience. And it eventually led to my next formative game...\n\n## Pokémon Red[^1]\n\nIf you're a gamer in your early-to-mid-30's, Pokémon is probably the game that introduced to you to the genre of role-playing games. That was definitely the case for me. I didn't know anything about RPGs, but I was just the right age for Pokémon fever and I had to play it. In the years since, RPGs have become my favorite type of game to play, and I owe it all to Pokémon.\n\n## The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker\n\nI went back and forth between including this or Ocarina of Time, but in the grand scheme of things I think Wind Waker had a much larger effect on me personally. It's my earliest memory of a game that really captivated me, and drew me into its world in a way that I could believe it was alive.

Ever since I discovered Terminal.app in the Utilities folder on my PowerBook G4 back in the day, I've been curious about the kinds of things I could do with it. For most of that time, I've really only used it to change hidden settings, and run tools like 'diskutil', but since entering the world of software development the terminal has become an indispensable tool.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy about the terminal is how customizable it is. If you're on macOS like I am, it can be a nice little reprieve from the relatively locked-down GUI. As such, I've had a lot of fun tweaking the Unix underpinnings of the Mac to my own preferences.\n\n### The Basics\n\nTo start off, let's look at the basic setup. Though macOS comes with the built-in Terminal.app I mentioned earlier, I prefer to use an app called [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com). There are a lot of alternative terminal emulators out there, and I've tried most of them, but I keep coming back to iTerm because it just feels at home on the Mac in the way Warp, Alacritty, and the like, just don't.\n\nFor the shell itself, I use ZSH, which is what ships by default on Mac. I'll admit I'm not sure what the pros and cons are versus something like Bash, but it works for me. I also use [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) for an extra level of customization.\n\nFinally, I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for my package manager. That seems to be the go-to solution for Mac. I use it to not only install and manage the CLI tools I use, but also any GUI apps I install outside the App Store. There's even a nice little app called [Cork](https://github.com/buresdv/Cork) which is a GUI app that makes dealing with Homebrew a lot nicer.\n\n### Themes and Plugins\n\nUsing ohmyzsh opens the door for a lot of easy customization. One of the other tools I use is [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), which can be used with or without ohmyzsh. This allows you to create a theme by mixing and matching several preset options. I went with a pretty barebones, minimal look, but you don't have to go that route.\n\nFor plugins, I use [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete), which is basically a search function and autocompletion for terminal commands. I also use [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), which not only adds a bit of color, but can be useful as well because it will color code valid commands in green and invalid ones in red.\n\n### Useful Tools\n\nThere are also a handful of useful tools I have installed that make using the command line a much more pleasant experience. I'm going to skip over ones like git and Homebrew, they're pretty much a necessity for developers, and instead focus on some tools I'd consider nice to have.\n\nAll of these tools can be installed via Homebrew.\n\n**gum**\n\nThis isn't so much a standalone tool as it is a way to easily add some interactivity to shell scripts. You can easily add text inputs, confirmation dialogs, list selections, and even loading spinners to your shell scripts. There's a lot, so I'd suggest checking out [the readme](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum/blob/main/README.md) to see if it's something you'd find useful.\n\n**mas**\n\nA CLI for the Mac App Store. It may seem a little redundant, but I find it a much more reliable way to update apps installed via the App Store since auto-update seems pretty hit-or-miss, and many times updates will not show for me at all in the GUI interface. Simply running `mas upgrade` will find and install updates much more reliably in my experience.\n\n**thefuck**\n\nEven with all my autocomplete and syntax highlighting shenanigans, I still sometimes make mistakes (ever do a git push without setting an origin?). All I have to do when I make these silly mistakes is run the command `fuck` and it will pretty reliably find and run the command you meant to run.\n\n**yt-dlp**\n\nI don't always have to download YouTube videos, but when I do, I use yt-dlp. It makes it pretty simple to download videos, and it's feels a lot less sketchy than using one of those YouTube downloader websites. Shameless plug, I also [built a GUI front end for it](https://github.com/ghall89/Siphon).\n\n**zoxide**\n\nUsing cd to navigate our computers is an everyday part of using the terminal, but zoxide makes that experience much better. On top just being able to navigate your folders just like with cd, zoxide can keep track of your most visited folders and lets you quickly navigate to them with a fuzzy search. So, say you have a folder you navigate to a lot with `cd ~/Developer/web/personal/my-cool-blog`, instead of having to type that out you can simply type `z web blog` and it will, like magic, take you right there. Also, if you're like me and have the cd command burned into your brain, you can set cd as an alias of z.","src/content/blog/2024/my-terminal-setup.md","8dfb2c1b5e92ae77",{"html":1402,"metadata":1403},"\u003Cp>The command line is something I’ve tinkered with for years.

No amount of factory resets would resolve the issue for more than a day, and eventually even AirPlay would just decide to randomly stop working.

Not sure what possessed me to try on that particular day, perhaps I was feeling a bit masochistic, but when I spoke the words, \"Hey Siri, play the new Taylor Swift album,\" I was met with silence.

For 2023, Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3 blew me away that I couldn’t fathom selecting a third game that stood up to them. This year however, I’m returning to the originally envisioned format for my top 3 games of 2024.\n\nOne of my regrets from the 2022 post was that I didn’t go into very much detail as to why I liked the games, so this time around I wanted to make sure to go more in-depth (but not too in-depth). So, over the course of the year, I’ve kept a journal of every game I finished in 2024, and wrote down what I thought about it while the experience was still fresh in my mind. I chose this list by re-reading my journal and picking the 3 games that, upon reflection, still resonate with me in the same way.\n\n### Star Wars: Outlaws\n\nOk, this is a controversial pick, but, despite its many flaws, Star Wars: Outlaws is a game I genuinely enjoyed from start to finish. Granted, many of its strengths are a result of it being a Star Wars game, but as a fan of the franchise that’s enough for me.\n\nTo me, this game nailed the feeling of being a roguish scoundrel going on adventures across the Star Wars galaxy. From classic locations such as Mos Eisley, to new places like Mirogana, it all felt authentically a part of that galaxy far, far away. It’s clear the people behind the game are big fans of the universe George Lucas created.\n\nEven the typical Ubisoft open-world tropes didn’t detract from the experience. In fact, setting the game across multiple planets, and therefore segmenting the game into smaller open areas instead of one huge map, did a lot to remove the tedium that comes with open-world games.\n\nAnother aspect of the game I enjoyed was the “Reputation System”. During the course of the game you’ll encounter and do missions for various criminal syndicates; The Hutts, The Pykes, Crimson Dawn, and the Ashiga Clan. Which missions you do, and whether you succeed or fail, will affect your standing with these organizations. Raising your reputation with a particular group can unlock special merchants, allow you to take higher paying missions, and freely move about the gangs territory. However, betraying a gang, stealing from them, entering restricted areas, or just being a menace towards them, will lower your reputation. It’s a cool system, and I think it has plenty of room for iteration in a sequel.\n\n### Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\nI have to say, this is the game that most surprised me this year. While I enjoyed Final Fantasy VII Remake–the first entry in this trilogy-to-be of games re-imagining the classic 90’s RPG–when I originally played it during Covid lockdown in 2020, I found it very tedious when I revisited it a couple years ago In addition, 2023’s Final Fantasy XVI left me a bit down on the series as a whole. But I gave Rebirth a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did.\n\nOne thing this game shares in common with the first entry is how well it handles real-time combat, especially compared to the more recent “mainline” entries. Final Fantasy XV’s real-time combat was tedious, while XVI’s was frustrating and shallow. I really appreciate the ability in this game to switch characters in combat to not only keep gameplay interesting, but provide a level of depth and control that the aforementioned mainline games just don’t.\n\nThe world design, similar to Star Wars: Outlaws, is more segmented, which makes the exploration much less tedious, and far more varied. Each map is littered with side objectives to encourage exploration, but it’s not so much that it’s overwhelming. The only 2 exceptions were Cosmo Canyon and Gongaga, which I found extremely convoluted and not at all enjoyable to navigate.\n\nThe game has a multitude of mini-games, which felt like a throwback to an older style of video game design, and I thought it was fun. They weren’t all bangers, but I did find myself engaging in Gwen…sorry, I mean, Queen’s Blood. Also, Chocobo Racing ended up being another big time sink. It was enough to keep me coming back for many more hours, even after I finished the story (and is probably why I didn’t finish more games this year 😬).\n\n### The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom\n\nIt goes without saying, if there’s a new Zelda game out it’s going to make my top 3 games of the year, no question. Like any other game, it’s not perfect. As the first brand-new “2D” Zelda in a decade, and the first in the series to star the titular princess, it had high expectations to live up to, but I think it ran away with them.\n\nIt’s the first Zelda game of this style to take on the open-world design of the 2 most recent 3D games–Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom–and it really fit a lot better that I was expecting. In fact, I’d say it did the open-world much better, because it was reigned in just enough to not impede on the storytelling (such as it is in a Nintendo title), but still gave the player a good level of freedom to explore.\n\nAnother area this game excels is the puzzles. Much like in Tears of the Kingdom, the puzzles in this game are more focused on player creativity and finding fun solutions than simply trying to figure out the one solution the designers intended. Much of this creativity comes from what this game calls “echoes”, basically various objects and enemies you can conjure up.\n\nI hope this is a concept Nintendo revisits, because I really want to see a successor to this game that iterates upon what is already great, and improves on what didn’t quite work. Basically, what Tears of the Kingdom did for Breath of the Wild.","src/content/blog/2024/my-top-3-games-of-2024.md","aeb241061d662d08",{"html":1450,"metadata":1451},"\u003Cp>Back in December 2022, I wrote about \u003Ca href=\"/posts/2022/my-top-3-games-of-2022/\">my top 3 games of that year\u003C/a> in what I hoped would be a yearly tradition.

I've also tried them working in a crowded cafe, and while I could still hear the chatter of the people around me, it was muffled enough to minimize any distraction.\n\nSpeaking on the phone or in meetings is still a bit strange and I feel like I have to shout.

I was having difficulty processing large batches of audio files efficiently, so I asked Codex to come up with some ideas to improve what I had wrote. It took a couple minutes to process everything, but it spat out some code and asked me to approve the changes.\n\nIt all looked good to me, so I gave it the OK, and ran the application. I was pretty impressed by the results, so I decided to take it a step further, and use it to implement a feature from scratch. So, I prompted it to create an audio playback queue, and connect it to the UI that I built. In less than 10 minutes, I had a very rough implementation of the feature up and running.\n\nThere were some structural changes I had to make to the batch processing code to be more reusable, and I still have a chunk of work to do on the playback queue, but Codex got me a lot further along than I would have got otherwise.\n\nThe other two use-cases – converting code from one language to another, and creating a project from scratch – were more along the lines of what I expected from Codex going in.\n\nThe code conversion experiment involved porting my app [KeyStash](https://github.com/ghall89/KeyStash) (an app for storing software license keys) from macOS to the web. While it did a serviceable job translating data structures, and approximating the UI, it made a lot of sloppy mistakes, like using an old and vulnerable version of Next.js, and referencing variables it didn’t even create. It even tried creating an image upload mechanism that not only didn’t even work, but wasn’t even a sensical addition. [^1]\n\nMy final experiment was pointing it to an empty directory and telling it to create a web-based rich text editor that can import and export .RTF files. It did a far better job with file uploads than the last experiment, but everything else was pretty poorly implemented. Though, it did manage to pull in more up-to-date dependencies. Also, while I wouldn’t call the code unreadable, I certainly would not want to maintain it.\n\nOf the three use-cases, the only one I can see as being remotely useful for anything, beyond just messing around with experiments like these, is making incremental changes to an existing codebase. These tools seem to be at their best when generating small bits of code with as much context as possible, and, incidentally, the cognitive load required to review its output is so much more manageable.\n\nIt’s crystal clear to me how generating swathes of code – either ported from an existing codebase, or starting from a blank-slate – is a recipe for poor maintainability. Even the relatively simple rich text editor that I “vibe coded” had enough code to sift through and debug that I probably would have been better off just writing it myself in the first place. If you’re of the belief that a developer should be responsible for the code they ship, regardless of if it was written by hand or an LLM[^2], it’s easy to see how that model of development is grossly unsustainable.\n\nAll that being said, it’s incredibly tempting to utilize these tools for just building stuff quickly, and dealing with the consequences later. I get why it’s so appealing, and I have found myself struggling – and occasionally, failing – to resist that temptation.
